        "body": "Thanks for the report! JAX follows the NumPy API convention for the meaning of `axis` in `norm`, and in NumPy 3 axes leads to an error. I suspect the reason is that the norm along one axis is treated as a vector norm, the norm along two axes is treated as a matrix norm, and there's no good convention for a norm of a 3D tensor. Still, we could probably improve the error message \u2013 what do you think?",
