These emerged because the closeness checking is changed in this PR and the mapping of inaccuracy lists requires updates re the tests that passed false-positively before. \n- jakevdp commented on 2024-03-13T17:16:13Z: Tests are failing on internal CPU.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the issue here is that these tests are too brittle: they make detailed assertions about the dark corners of hardware-dependent implementation details. Rather than add more exceptions for particular backends / package versions / devices / etc. I think it would be better to make the tests simpler and less brittle. What do you think?\n- pearu commented on 2024-03-13T17:16:22Z: `xla_extension_version >= 244` needs to be updated as the current `xla_extension_version` value conflicts with the one in the main branch, hence the test failures.\n- pearu commented on 2024-03-13T17:52:29Z: > ...

I'm not certain what may be causing it.\r\n\r\nThe failure occurs in the case where `n_sparse = 1`.  The reason for extending the 1D lhs to 2D is that in `cusparse.py`, both `coo_matvec` and `coo_matmat` require `rows, cols = shape`.  \r\nhttps://github.dev/google/jax/blob/8381a4ade0bdff7869e95e1c0ab6b326bf7aca3a/jaxlib/cusparse.py#L276-L277\r\n\r\nI think instead of going from 1D to 2D and then back to 1D , we should add  `coo_vecmat` in `cusparse.py`. This will be helpful for cases where n_batch and n_dense are not zeros.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-11-12T16:25:06Z: (summarizing offline convo: cusparse doesn't have a sparse vec-mat operation, but it does have a [sparse vec-vec](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/index.html#cusparse-generic-function-spvv) operation. So for the latter it would probably make sense to expose it in `cusparse.py`, but for the former we'll have to do reshapes at some level anyway. At this point I think the routines in `cusparse.py` should essentially have a 1-to-1 mapping to routines provided by cusparse)\n",

Just FYI, the transpose rule is a different sense of the word \"transpose\" than in the issue in #7533: transpose rules are used to implement reverse-mode autodiff (vjp). The reason I stopped before implementing it here is because it became clear that batching was more important (e.g. you can't use `jacfwd` or `jacrev` to test autodiff without batching being implemented) so I changed my focus to developing the batched COO format (BCOO in the source) which now has batching & full autodiff implemented.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in contributing this transpose rule, we'd also need to add a test that exercises it similar to coo_matvec's autodiff test here: https://github.com/google/jax/blob/38cb2b530aaecc74443de373f27a0ee143b6166d/tests/sparse_test.py#L319-L363\r\n\r\nThe \"reverse mode\" sections there are where the transpose rule will be called.\n- dimasad commented on 2021-08-06T22:01:53Z: > Thanks for this!

The PR contains N/A commits, with 0 additions and 0 deletions across 0 files. \n\nBody: No description available\n\nComments:\n- trevorcai commented on 2020-06-16T12:14:28Z: I did part of the requested analysis. The float32 numerics generally agree for all versions of `log_softmax`. In bfloat16, the `stop_gradient` version is closer to the `f32` numerics than without `stop_gradient` when measured with inputs & cotangents sampled from `jax.random.normal`.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising, given that the version without `stop_gradient` matches the f32 training curve, while including it causes a divergence. I don't have a strong conclusion for why this may be the case.\r\n\r\nI did identify that `grad(log_softmax)` in bf16 is biased to be too high, because `exp` when computed in f32 and casted to bf16 is biased to be too low. The errors in the version without `stop_gradient` oppose this bias; it's possible that this helps during training.\r\n\r\nI implemented a `jax.custom_vjp` for `log_softmax` following the TensorFlow gradient definition. It's both faster and closer to the f32 numerics than both the alternatives. This still doesn't match the f32 curves, but is closer than the current version.\r\n\r\nGiven that we don't understand why the version with worse numerics and slower runtime seems to imitate f32 better in practice, I think we should **not** merge this PR. Everyone using f32 benefits from current HEAD, and the benefits for bf16 folks are unclear.\r\n\r\nI've worked around this by just computing `log_softmax` in f32.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned `custom_vjp` gives a small speedup and reduction in activations stored. If it can be rewritten as a `custom_jvp` (not sure how), I'd recommend adding it to HEAD:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@jax.custom_vjp\r\ndef log_softmax(x):\r\n  return jax.nn.log_softmax(x)\r\n\r\ndef lsm_fwd(x):\r\n  out = log_softmax(x)\r\n  return out, out\r\n\r\ndef lsm_bwd(res, g):\r\n  out = res\r\n  dx = g - jnp.sum(g, axis=-1, keepdims=True) * jnp.exp(out)\r\n  return (dx,)\r\n\r\nlog_softmax.defvjp(lsm_fwd, lsm_bwd)\r\n```\r\n \n",

But, I don't think that this is quite the right change. This new error message would expose JAX internal APIs which we definitely don't want to do. I would argue that this is actually really a misuse of `custom_partitioning`, so I'd say that the error message is actually perfect :D \r\n\r\nHere's how I would recommend refactoring the code. Instead of wrapping your primitive impl in `custom_partitioning`, move that to `double_prim_call`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n...\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Define the Implementation\r\n- @custom_partitioning\r\ndef double_prim_impl(x):\r\n    return 2 * x  # Linear operation\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n+ @custom_partitioning\r\ndef double_prim_call(x):\r\n    return double_prim_p.bind(x)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n+ double_prim_call.def_partition(\r\n+     infer_sharding_from_operands=infer_sharding_from_operands, partition=partition\r\n+ )\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then everything works as expected!\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\n- ASKabalan commented on 2025-01-09T13:51:47Z: Thank you for your answer\r\n\r\nThe problem is custom_partition lowering is not vmappable nor differentiable\r\nthis is an example of what you suggest\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport os\r\nos.environ[\"JAX_PLATFORM_NAME\"] = \"cpu\"\r\nos.environ[\"XLA_FLAGS\"] = \"--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=8\"\r\n\r\nfrom jax import core, lax\r\nfrom jax.interpreters import mlir, ad, batching\r\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\r\nimport jax\r\nfrom jax.experimental.custom_partitioning import custom_partitioning\r\nfrom jax._src import dispatch\r\nimport jax.extend as jex\r\n\r\nfrom jax.sharding import NamedSharding\r\nfrom jax.sharding import PartitionSpec as P\r\nfrom functools import partial\r\n\r\npdims = (8,)\r\nmesh = jax.make_mesh(pdims , axis_names=('x'))\r\nsharding = NamedSharding(mesh, P('x'))\r\n\r\n# ================================\r\n# Double Primitive Rules\r\n# ================================\r\n\r\n# Step 1: Define the Primitive\r\ndouble_prim_p = jex.core.Primitive(\"double_prim\")\r\ndispatch.prim_requires_devices_during_lowering.add(double_prim_p)\r\n# Step 2: Define the Implementation\r\n#@custom_partitioning\r\ndef double_prim_impl(x):\r\n    return 2 * x  #

Pallas is not yet as feature-rich or stable as JAX, Also I know the Pallas is good for low-level pro. but it is still an experimental project within the JAX ecosystem. As I comment down the Pallas code in the kernal so it simplifies the kernal to use JAX's well supported features. It can run on CPU and GPU without errors. Hope this answer satisfy you. :)\n- ayaka14732 commented on 2024-08-22T15:34:28Z: Wrong\n",

Fixed by setting in_fwd instead of out_fwd for those.\n- mattjj commented on 2024-03-15T16:13:42Z: Thanks so much for looking at this! I'm in meetings for the next 90 mins but would like to review this, since it's scary to me that there was a bug here in the first place, so we should be sure to get it right this time.\r\n\r\nI'd love to write more exhaustive tests too, covering all the cases...\n- mattjj commented on 2024-03-15T17:40:10Z: @nshepperd thanks so much for diving in to attack this bug! \r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should merge #20273 instead of this PR. That PR does two things:\r\n1. Rewrites the logic to try to be more obviously correct. That may be a subjective thing, but I think refactoring it to do the two forwarding optimizations one after another, rather than trying to do them at the same time as before, makes it easier to see they won't interfere with each other.\r\n2. Disables the optimization entirely until we can add more tests. It was a mistake for me to merge this change without exhaustive tests in the first place. So I want to disable it until we can thoroughly test.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\n- nshepperd commented on 2024-03-16T11:45:30Z: Hehe, I guess you merged it. LGTM though. Good test cases!\n",

NumPy does not have `.H` and `.mH`, and this idea has been proposed and rejected on several occasions (see e.g. https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8882 and links within). In the Array API standard, the idea is being considered (https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/555), but is not yet part of the standard, though it appears to be on the draft roadmap for a future revision: https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/643.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that we shouldn't add this, but it means there is a higher bar before we consider adding such syntax. Some of the concerns in the above discussions don't really apply to JAX, particularly in JIT-compiled mode where the hermitian transpose operation can be optimized away. If the array API standard adds this, we should ensure that JAX's definition is compliant, otherwise we might be facing a rather painful deprecation process for adjusting the syntax in the near future.\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, I think we should hold off on this for now \u2013 what do you think?\n- gautierronan commented on 2024-01-07T17:29:07Z: Thanks for your detailed answer. My point of view on the matter is that this feature is:\r\n\r\n1. very simple to add and maintain,\r\n2. very practical for users who work on complex arrays regularly (I personally use `x.conj().T` tens of times every day),\r\n3. already implemented in pytorch (although they are much less compliant with the numpy API of course).\r\n\r\nThat being said, your arguments are also very sound. I'll let you guys decide, but I'm very much in favor of the feature :)\n",

Locally I went ahead and tried the uncoupled one:\r\n```\r\nreturn np.sum(100. * (x[::2]**2 - x[1::2]) ** 2 + (x[:-1] - 1) ** 2)   \r\n```\r\nand (L)BFGS still fails. It seems the problem lies with BFGS here. Unfortunately, I don't have time to track down the issue what the issue is with BFGS and why it's failing this test. \n- jakevdp commented on 2023-03-13T19:10:32Z: I don't think the expression in your last comment is correct for the uncoupled function. You should use `x[::2]` instead of `x[:-1]`\n- packquickly commented on 2023-03-13T19:17:39Z: Ah! Indeed, thanks for catching that. Sadly, this leads to no change in the test outcome.\n",

Can you please add some tests for the new functionality? Existing tests for this function can be found here: https://github.com/google/jax/blob/b4ec72deaefa1094891829cd0b78efb5cc19c28b/tests/scipy_ndimage_test.py#L79\n- LouisDesdoigts commented on 2023-03-08T03:55:43Z: Hey Jake thanks for picking this up! \r\n\r\nSo I've locally updated the tests to cover the third order interpolation however I've implemented a version with a different boundary condition, scipy uses the 'not-a-knot' condition as far as I can tell (they are not explicit about the particular algorithm they use) whereas I've implemented 'natural' boundary conditions. This gives machine precision matching results at the inner parts of the array, but differing results at the boundaries (shown below).\r\n\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1016\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 2 52 24 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42196907/223615451-fc028797-d2de-40cb-869c-e001529c9fc9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existing tests use arrays of shapes (5,), (3, 4), (3, 4, 5) meaning that the tests comparing to scipy fail and can't just compare the central portion as the arrays are too small. I'm wondering what the way forward is here. I haven't been able to solve this problem for the 'not-a-knot' boundary conditions, which may not even be the correct one and I think will require an entirely different implementation \ud83d\ude2c. I'm thinking as a solution the tests for third order could use larger arrays and only compare the inner regions (which isn't exactly ideal, but works) and specifying in the docs about using different boundary conditions to scipy.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!\n- shoyer commented on 2023-03-08T17:42:53Z: Did you see the discussion in https://github.com/google/jax/issues/5687?\r\n\r\nThe existing linear interpolation scheme is somewhat inconsistent with scipy but we would like to fix this. In particular see the proposed solution in https://github.com/google/jax/issues/5687#issuecomment-776866617\r\n\r\nIs your PR consistent with one of SciPy (new) supported boundary modes?\r\nhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/ndimage.html#interpolation-boundary-handling\n- LouisDesdoigts commented on 2023-03-09T03:15:09Z: Yes I'm aware of the current issues with the boundary mode and have been following these, my PR does not address anything to do with this. The issue you linked is to do with the boundary _mode_, how the output coordinates are mapped outside of the range of the input coordinates, which is different to the boundary _conditions_ I'm referring to in my above comments. \r\n\r\nThe boundary conditions are a set of extra conditions at the boundary of the arrays that are needed to solve for the spline coefficients, of which there are a few although scipy doesn't provide options for this. The plot in the above comment is defined entirely within the input coordinates so there are no effects from the boundary mode.\r\n\r\nThere should be no issues with any future changes made to the boundary modes since this just changes how the output coordinates are mapped, which are then subsequently fed into the interpolation algorithm. \n- JamesAllingham commented on 2023-04-20T10:42:24Z: I just wanted to mention that it would be great to have this merged, even if it does not match the scipy boundary conditions. Figuring out what those boundary conditions even are and then implementing them would be challenging. And having some form of cubic interpolation for `map_ccordinates` is better than having none :) \r\n\r\nI am happy to help out with making this happen if you need it. Let me know what needs to be done! \n- LouisDesdoigts commented on 2023-04-21T04:45:48Z: @JamesAllingham If you need something now you can build my jax fork from source until we get this though https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/jax. Also feel free to send me your email and I can add you to a thread I have trying to sort this out! Any help is greatly appreciated!\n- benjaminpope commented on 2023-04-26T01:48:51Z: Just checking on this - this is a dependency for some science we are currently doing. \n- shoyer commented on 2023-04-26T01:55:31Z: I really appreciate you putting this together, but I don't think it's a good idea for JAX's cubic spline code to diverge further from SciPy. The JAX team does not have the expertise on the numerics of splines to get this code right.\r\n\r\nI would suggest either:\r\n\r\n1. Work on getting these features into SciPy. Once they have been merged over there, we would be happy to consider your PR to mirror the features in JAX.\r\n2. Release a separate library with JAX splines (JAX is open source, after all). We would be happy to include a link in the relevant section of the JAX docs.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-03T22:31:57Z: Thanks for this \u2013\u00a0I think given the discussion in https://github.com/google/jax/pull/18137, this functionality is probably out-of-scope for jax core.

I'm waiting for my company to create a google group!\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-12T11:38:41Z: Hi!

Then we can do some internal testing against tensorflow with `_xla_extension_version` bumped to `39` before merging. What do you think?\n- SaturdayGenfo commented on 2021-09-28T14:45:04Z: There was a reference to the gees wrapper that was just in the body of the `linalg.py` primitives file, I put it in the scope of the schur primitive so it doesn't cause any issues without calls to the primitive. I also added an `if _xla_extension_version > 38` condition that skips the test for older version.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-09-28T15:54:22Z: Also, once you address that final change, please squash the changes into a single commit (see https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#single-change-commits-and-pull-requests) Thanks!\n- hawkinsp commented on 2021-09-28T15:55:53Z: > There was a reference to the gees wrapper that was just in the body of the `linalg.py` primitives file, I put it in the scope of the schur primitive so it doesn't cause any issues without calls to the primitive. I also added an `if _xla_extension_version > 38` condition that skips the test for older version.\r\n\r\nThinking about this, I think it's probably even better to use the condition `jax._src.lib.version >= (0, 1, 72)`.\r\n\r\nYou can think about `_xla_extension_version` as the version of the XLA/TF source trees. In this case, this code is in the JAX tree, so I think your best bet is to use a version number defined in that tree also. (Ideally we'd have a monotonic version number in the JAX tree as well, but the jaxlib version number will do fine I think.)\n- hawkinsp commented on 2021-09-28T15:58:39Z: You have some flake8 lint failures as well.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-09-28T16:15:32Z: @hawkinsp - the reason I suggested checking `xla_extension_version` is because I was planning to patch the CL to update the extension version and run internal tests for the new codepaths. If we gate on jaxlib release, we won't see any potential failures in CI until the next version of jaxlib is released (unless kokoro is doing a jaxlib build from source, which I don't think is the case?)\n- hawkinsp commented on 2021-09-28T16:19:49Z: Kokoro *is* doing a jaxlib build from source for at least two of the builds. So we should see the failures right here in Github.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-09-28T16:21:11Z: Thanks, that makes sense. Agreed that checking on `jax._src.lib.version` is the better option here.\n- google-cla[bot] commented on 2021-09-28T18:36:48Z: All (the pull request submitter and all commit authors) CLAs are signed, **but** one or more commits were authored or co-authored by someone other than the pull request submitter.\n\nWe need to confirm that all authors are ok with their commits being contributed to this project.

This greatly reduces the overhead of the final linear solve, since the relevant system is now triangular. It also allows the iteration to terminate early if convergence is reached midway through the Arnoldi iterations.\r\n\r\nThis makes complete sense! I think it may also improve numerical stability.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `apply_givens_rotation` is another un-vectorized loop, so this _might_ significantly slow things down on accelerators. If that is the case, then we might want to have two implementations: the Given rotation version allowing for early termination, and the version that runs for some fixed number of iterations.\r\n\r\nTo inform this decision, it would be helpful to do have microbenchmarks results, similar to those I had in https://gist.github.com/shoyer/dc33a5850337b6a87d48ed97b4727d29\n- gehring commented on 2020-08-29T20:27:58Z: @googlebot I consent.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-02T05:22:43Z: You are right the extra loop could conceivably lead to a large speedup on accelerators in certain use cases - those in which the matvec operation does not entirely dominate the expense. \r\n\r\nHowever, a GPU user may also encounter a case where this operation does dominate, but the ability to terminate the Arnoldi iterations early is important (for example, because GMRES is to be run on many different problems in sequence over the course of an iteration, and the appropriate incoming Krylov dimension is therefore not known.\r\n\r\nI would therefore, in the case that the original implementation were found to be sometimes favourable, recommend that the user be provided with both options when switching to the GPU.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-14T14:55:10Z: Just letting you all know I'm back from vacation (which is where I've been) and am working on this again. Updates to follow once I've made them.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-14T15:06:49Z: @mganahl Your comments don't seem to have attached themselves to the relevant lines of code, so I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, but in sequence:\r\n\r\n- All print commands will indeed likely be removed;\r\n- This implementation of GMRES allows b and x0 to be a data structure called a pytree that I honestly don't understand very well (it might be something to look into for symmetric tensors however). Along with a few other quirks, the tree_map statements are there to support this structure.\r\n- Early stopping of Arnoldi should I think be redundant with early stopping of GMRES. But we do have a tolerance threshold that stops the normalizations from blowing up just in case.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-14T20:41:45Z: I've added better tests and done a bit of fiddling. The present implementation appears to give comparable (actually slightly better) error as SciPy when it works, but is also much more unstable than SciPy, failing completely in many cases that SciPy handles easily (for example, in most cases when maxiter > 1, and even for maxiter == 1 in some cases). The reason for this is not yet clear.\n- shoyer commented on 2020-09-14T21:10:23Z: It might be make sense to look over SciPy's implementation to see if it handles any edge cases that we don't handle here. The source code for SciPy's iterative solvers can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/sparse/linalg/isolve\r\n\r\nThe GMRES implementation uses a mix of Python and Fortran:\r\nhttps://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/914523af3bc03fe7bf61f621363fca27e97ca1d6/scipy/sparse/linalg/isolve/iterative.py#L432\r\nhttps://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/914523af3bc03fe7bf61f621363fca27e97ca1d6/scipy/sparse/linalg/isolve/iterative/GMRESREVCOM.f.src\r\n\r\n(You might also or alternatively consider implementing L-GMRES, which I've found to be generally a superior alternative to GMRES with restarts.)\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-15T16:38:18Z: The SciPy code isn't the easiest on Earth to read, is it? Still, I'm hopeful because the TensorNetwork version does not suffer these instabilities. Lemme poke a bit more. \n- gehring commented on 2020-09-15T17:03:18Z: Current, I've identified 2 failure modes in the previous implementation. The 1st was the normalization causing nans and is already handled, but the second I only recently identified and is caused by trying to solve a zero/singular matrix once the basis was constructed (a problem that is made more common when thresholding the normalization). It might be worth checking if that is what is happening here. The fix should be straightforward if that is the case.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-15T17:21:21Z: Excellent, this is very likely the problem. This may have something to do\nwith the input matrix having large condition number. That, however, is not\nthe full picture because I find the algorithm consistently breaks down when\nA is the identity matrix, which is obviously invertible.\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Sep 15, 2020 at 1:03 PM gehring <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Current, I've identified 2 failure modes in the previous.

CPU performance seems to be comparable to SciPy, but the mystery Colab GPU performs much (~ 10X) more slowly. The GPU runtimes appear to be almost independent of the matrix size, which strongly suggests something about the GMRES overhead (rather than the matvec itself) is the culprit. I haven't checked the QR version against the fixed-iteration one yet.\r\n\r\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DZBFNQeXiDuiyPxXRCJFnuSknaUzB1HU?usp=sharing\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-16T18:22:15Z: The difference between the fixed and QR implementations seems to be minor; in addition CPU performance is actually a bit slower than SciPy. Perhaps there's some sort of vectorization trickery I'm missing?\n- shoyer commented on 2020-09-16T19:04:33Z: > The difference between the fixed and QR implementations seems to be minor; in addition CPU performance is actually a bit slower than SciPy. Perhaps there's some sort of vectorization trickery I'm missing?\r\n\r\nYou want to be careful to always `jit` the outer-most function when you are benchmarking in JAX, and to use `block_until_ready()`. I did a few tweaks to make that work in your notebook:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/shoyer/2f86513877fcbf044cea964060dd8de3\r\n\r\nOtherwise you are mostly measuring JIT compilation time, not computation time.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-16T20:43:45Z: Alright, well I don't quite understand why I'm unable to reproduce your profiling here, but based on your notebook we seem to have the following results at the given parameters:\r\n\r\n- On the CPU, the QR implementation is significantly (~30%) faster than the fixed one, even when we don't terminate early.\r\n- On the GPU, the QR implementation is about 10x slower than the fixed one.\r\n- The final linear solve consumes about 40% of the overall runtime.\r\n\r\nThe latter result would seem to indicate that SciPy's ability to dynamically resize the Arnoldi matrix potentially confers a significant advantage, and thus our workaround is perhaps not ideal (although it may be unavoidable). In addition, it seems that maintaining both implementations is desirable.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pointing out that the case where the matvec operator multiplies by a known dense matrix is kind of a weird edge case - unless the matrix were known to be well approximated by a low-dimensional Krylov space, a dense solver would probably be preferred. So the large impact of the GMRES overhead compared to the matvec itself may be misleading. Certainly this is the case in TensorNetwork applications.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-16T20:50:41Z: The \"fixed\" implementation could be made to end the Arnoldi process once an invariant subspace was found, without necessarily involving the QR loop. This would probably have similar properties re: early termination as the QR one without breaking the GPU so badly. It would still be worth keeping both I think, since the QR has other advantages.\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-18T15:20:07Z: I've noticed that both CG and gmres currently store the Arnoldi vectors as the columns of V rather than the rows. Since by default we presumably use row-major linear ordering this seems potentially problematic, especially on the GPU. Would it be worth transposing the program?\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-22T17:58:51Z: I found a bug I need to fix before this is ready; but does anyone know why the Read the Docs build is failing?\n- alewis commented on 2020-09-22T19:06:16Z: Ok, this one seems to work.

This turns up the following error:\r\n```\r\nE     AssertionError:\r\nE     Not equal to tolerance rtol=0.04, atol=0.008\r\nE\r\nE     Mismatch: 25%\r\nE     Max absolute difference: 1.0214233\r\nE     Max relative difference: 0.09353104\r\nE      x: array([-37.997494,   3.304602,  70.99634 , 318.19443 ], dtype=float32)\r\nE      y: array([-37.312508,   3.021955,  70.98675 , 317.173   ], dtype=float32)\r\n```\r\nBut really, this is close enough. So if we used these tests, I would be fine relaxing the error tolerance as needed.\n- sunilkpai commented on 2020-07-24T22:35:20Z: Hi @shoyer I'm still fighting my code to get scipy and bicgstab to agree; they agree for many cases (especially higher numerical precision) but begin to deviate in some special cases. I've done a number of things to check what the differences are and I'm beginning to suspect that it has something to do with numerical precision becoming increasingly important after several steps (generally not after the first step). I checked scipy's implementation (and even hacked into their `bicgstab` function to print out intermediate values). Wondering what your testing procedure was so I can resolve these issues more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe test I have started to run now is to write a numpy version of `bicgstab` and then to compare that version with the jax version to make sure things roughly agree given essentially the same code. But even this starts to disagree (with both `scipy` and `jax`); my current hypothesis is because of slight differences in implementation in methods such as `vdot` (order of addition seems to matter at times for numerical precision). \r\n\r\nHere is some example failure case output tracking `bicgstab` iterations for the `scipy` implementation and my `numpy` implementation for `float32[4, 4]`. It's worth noting that I've observed simulations in the past where `bicgstab` fails for `complex64` and not `complex128`, so precision appears to be a key factor in determining the success of `bicgstab`.\r\n```\r\nIteration 1: # this iteration looks fine\r\nr: numpy [-0.7498561 -2.9607344  5.9396653 -3.6000998] scipy [-0.74985594 -2.9607344   5.9396653  -3.6000998 ]\r\np: numpy [ 2.845481    0.93953496 -0.43305653 -1.9908385 ] scipy [ 2.845481    0.93953496 -0.43305653 -1.9908385 ]\r\nt: numpy [44.767788  -6.7145605 15.403215  21.610672 ] scipy [44.767788  -6.7145605 15.403215  21.610674 ]\r\nq: numpy [ 13.488404  15.618371 -25.598196   6.009314] scipy [ 13.488404   15.618371  -25.598196    6.0093145]\r\nshat: numpy [-0.5489147 -2.9908729  6.008803  -3.5030997] scipy [-0.5489147 -2.9908729  6.008803  -3.5030997]\r\n\r\nIteration 2: # things start to change more here but still fine\r\nr: numpy [-1.3085905 -1.9914868  4.1542206 -3.6563268] scipy [-1.3085957 -1.9914829  4.1542125 -3.656325 ]\r\np: numpy [-4.5599647 -4.1502147  6.374942  -0.8395064] scipy [-4.559961   -4.1502132   6.3749413  -0.83950925]\r\nt: numpy [ 28.715466 -17.281141  27.14217   29.973507] scipy [ 28.715366 -17.281208  27.142246  29.973562]\r\nq: numpy [ 24.778402 -29.029495  51.462784  14.110635] scipy [ 24.778421 -29.029476  51.462746  14.110645]\r\nshat: numpy [-1.8608497 -1.6591338  3.6322193 -4.232781 ] scipy [-1.8608582 -1.6591254  3.6322048 -4.2327857]\r\n\r\nIteration 3: # oh boy...\r\nr numpy [-0.00711237 -0.12015637  0.1177693  -0.10020799] scipy[-0.0025171  -0.11048866  0.0973189  -0.08428508]\r\np numpy [ 2.093349   1.931221  -1.9813652 -3.183013 ] scipy [ 2.0936446  1.9315835 -1.9819365 -3.1829684]\r\nt: numpy [ 1.0321703  -0.27053687  0.5031162   0.84241974] scipy [ 0.8828936  -0.21744165  0.4108755   0.73308885]\r\nq: numpy [  5.698114   8.345237 -17.993662  15.740916] scipy [  5.6956105   8.347048  -17.997128   15.740109 ]\r\nshat: numpy [-0.027246   -0.11487925  0.10795546 -0.11664033] scipy [-0.02184983 -0.10572734  0.08832195 -0.10033754]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncidentally, after using more random cases than is currently recommended, I noticed `cg` failed a few scipy comparison tests, either due to similar reasons or changes I've made to the tests.

How does the accuracy of the final solution compare?\r\n\r\nSciPy is probably always using float64 precision. It might be worth enabling x64 mode for JAX, just for the sake of comparison. This currently requires a special flags:\r\nhttps://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#Double-(64bit)-precision\r\n\r\nIf the error does not decrease when you turn on x64 mode, then perhaps we are missing something important and should be worried! In that case I would look into the early termination conditions.\n- sunilkpai commented on 2020-07-25T00:16:51Z: @shoyer Yeah, you might be right for this case, but I think this becomes magnified as `n` gets higher (e.g. `n = 32` becomes a problem, this was just an unlucky case for `n = 4` that was easy to use as an example of what may go wrong). I will try your suggestion and see if anything changes!\n- sunilkpai commented on 2020-07-25T00:31:41Z: Also, re: early termination, this case may actually be necessary when s = 0 for `bicgstab`, which is an error case generated by some of the pytree tests. If `s = 0` then `t = 0` as well, resulting in `nan` evaluation for `omega`!\n- sunilkpai commented on 2020-07-25T23:33:00Z: Hi @shoyer this is still wip but I am getting closer I think thanks to your help! I have been adding your suggestions for the testing framework. Some checks between numpy and scipy are necessary (since there are differences and numerical failure cases) and therefore are now part of the tests. \r\n\r\nThe `exact` test for `cg` seems to be the culprit in the above CI failure (either due to some unintentional changes i made to the test or just the fact that it's a different matrix). There are also random failures for `bicgstab` in a more exhaustive test setting... all depends on the matrix (verified this by adding extra characters to the test name to generate new set of cases). Generally this occurs on roughly about 5% of the tests or so, sometimes the error is small (twice the rel tolerance) other times very large (orders of mag larger than tolerance).\n",

Each example that we add to the JAX repo increases the maintenance cost, and we need to be careful to ensure that we incur cost only where there is a unique advantage to maintaining the code in our repo. Perhaps we should have been more careful in the past with some of the examples that are already in the repo.\r\n\r\nI did a quick search for [physical optimization jax](https://www.google.com/search?q=physical+optimization+jax) and this example pops up.

What if I'm using `isinstance` checks to see if I can safely use NumPy attributes, like `dtype` and `shape`?\n- mattjj commented on 2019-08-01T02:15:37Z: @shoyer let's keep discussing this! Though we should keep in mind we're going for \"best reasonable solution\" rather than \"perfect.\"\r\n\r\nAttributes like `dtype` and `shape` work under a `jit` (because scalars are always 0d arrays) but not without a `jit`. But that doesn't seem so bad because NumPy ascribes dtypes and shapes to Python scalars already (i.e. the output of `onp.result_type` and `onp.shape` respectively). A separate argument is that using `isinstance` to look for attributes arguably goes against the Python duck-typing spirit.\r\n\r\nBut I am concerned if you think this 'fix' is worse. Can you say more about how this might be worse? Is it about diverging further from NumPy/Python scalar behavior, or rather about having different behavior under `jit` (specifically around isinstance and how it relates to attributes being available)?\r\n\r\nMaybe another principle we should include here is the principle of least surprise. Is `isinstance(3, np.ndarray)` surprising?\n- shoyer commented on 2019-08-01T03:01:11Z: Honestly, I'm a little amazed that JAX manages to make `isinstance` with `jax.numpy.ndarray` work at all :). \r\n\r\nPerhaps we should think about use cases? For the use case of checking for arrays/scalars vs. other non-primitive Python things inside some sort of nested Python data structure, `isinstance(3, np.ndarray)` seems perfectly reasonable. So maybe this is fine after all...\n- shoyer commented on 2019-08-01T03:05:03Z: I cannot think of circumstances when it would be useful to distinguish between Python scalars and arrays with JAX, with the possible exception of value-based casting (and that can be handled by some separate mechanism). It does seems like something like `np.is_number_or_array()` would be the right way to handle this, but NumPy doesn't provide that API \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642 \n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-06-24T15:12:03Z: Closing this PR, since it's fairly stale at this point.\r\n\r\nI think #1080 is to some extent working as intended; `jit` has the effect of promoting scalars to `ndarrays`. So far we are mostly happy with that choice, but it is not completely transparent to introspection tools like `isinstance`.\n",

You can write your neural network prediction function to operate on single example vectors at a time, then just call `vmap` to make it operate on batches and it'll be just as efficient as if you'd carried through the batch dimension by hand.\r\n\r\n[This blog post](https://blog.evjang.com/2019/02/maml-jax.html) has some more examples.\r\n\r\nHere's a cool one from examples/kernel_lsq.py:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom functools import partial\r\n\r\nimport jax.numpy as np\r\nfrom jax import vmap, make_jaxpr\r\n\r\ndef gram(kernel, xs):\r\n  return vmap(lambda x: vmap(lambda y: kernel(x, y))(xs))(xs)\r\n\r\nxs = np.zeros((100, 3))  # 100 data points, 3 feature dimensions\r\n\r\nlinear_kernel = np.vdot\r\nprint make_jaxpr(partial(gram, linear_kernel))(xs)\r\n# { lambda  ;  ; a.\r\n#   let b = transpose[ permutation=(1, 0) ] a\r\n#       c = dot a b\r\n#   in c }\r\n\r\nrbf_kernel = lambda x, y: np.exp(np.sum(x - y)**2)\r\nprint make_jaxpr(partial(gram, rbf_kernel))(xs)\r\n\r\n# { lambda g ;  ; a.\r\n#   let b = broadcast[ sizes=(1,) ] a\r\n#       c = transpose[ permutation=(1, 0, 2) ] b\r\n#       d = broadcast[ sizes=(1,) ] a\r\n#       e = sub c d\r\n#       f = reduce_sum[ axes=(2,)\r\n#                       input_shape=(100, 100, 3) ] e\r\n#       h = pow f g\r\n#       i = exp h\r\n#   in i }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n",

That seems like the appropriate thing to do to me, but not sure if you want that in this PR.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2019-03-14T13:43:06Z: Yes, you're right, the other NaN functions are also missing tests for that reason. However, fixing it isn't hard.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping we can turn on correct-by-default NaN handling this week, and then the issue will be moot. Until then, you could just add this code to the test Python program, perhaps somewhere at the start:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nos.environ['XLA_FLAGS'] = '--xla_cpu_enable_fast_math=false'\r\n```\n",

Would we ever suggest anyone use this functionality as-is? My feeling is that it's so unlikely to produce acceptable results that we would never recommend using it, and so I think we should have it fail fast instead of allowing people to stumble into hard-to-debug OOMs, etc. The warning may help, but it still seems worse than immediately getting an error saying you can't do grad of pjit.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are cases where the current behavior is predictably useful though?\n- apaszke commented on 2021-06-03T09:43:36Z: One potential reason to allow this is that I've been thinking that maybe it would make sense to forbid nesting `pjit`s and `xmap`s in `jit`, because the replication might be a bit of a footgun, but we could allow adding a trivial `pjit` outside of an xmap to achieve the same purpose (but the user explicitly acknowledging that there might be parallel computations inside and that the inputs at that point should not get sharded).\r\n\r\nBut yeah, apart from that I don't think this is useful. At the same time, it might be a good prototype to show to the XLA team and ask for improvements on their side.\n- skye commented on 2021-06-03T20:46:50Z: I'm not sure I understand your suggestion around nested jit/pmap/xmap. Why would you put anything in a `jit`? Or a `pjit`? What does that have to do with `grad`? This might be easier to discuss over chat or video.\r\n\r\n+1 to asking XLA team for improvements! I think it would be super useful if we could ask XLA for intermediate sharding annotations of a computation (this has also come up for host_callback and probably other things I'm forgetting). I'm guessing this would be a non-trivial feature request to implement, but we can start the discussion at least.\n",

So, the cudnn attention means cudnn flash attention now.

Do you mean sth like:\r\n\r\nThat looks correct. We have two options here:\r\n1. Have multiple SDPA functions, one per backend/implementation.\r\n2. Have a single API with the `implementation` option. \r\n\r\nThere are pros and cons of each, and some tricky questions. For example:\r\n- How closely do numerics need to match in the super-function to be considered 'the same'? As found in this review, cuDNN with bf16 inputs does not cast the first matmul to BF16 before doing softmax, whilst XLA does. If we choose the cuDNN convention, the XLA implementation will be incredibly memory-inefficient. This might be a significant difference in certain applications (eg. training with one but doing inference with the other on a different device-type). With future Pallas kernels, we can match the numerics. But this might be harder for third-party libraries like cuDNN. We might also do autotuning and choose the best kernel with the `None` option, which becomes problematic with these numerical differences. This is an argument to have separate functions for third-party kernels that JAX has no control over and are largely opaque (hard to see what numerical choices are being made), and only have a super-function for implementations under JAX-control. \r\n- Another argument for separate functions is that the API can be restricted to only the supported features, rather than the most general function imaginable. The current design is makes it hard for users to see what is supported, and limits documentation opportunities. In addition, there are cuDNN specific options (like the philox dropout) unsupported by any other backend, further complicating the API.\n- sbodenstein commented on 2024-06-14T12:37:08Z: I think the name should be `dot_product_attention` rather than `scaled_dot_product_attention`. Its also more consistent with Flax naming (https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/api_reference/flax.linen/_autosummary/flax.linen.dot_product_attention.html).\n- sbodenstein commented on 2024-06-24T17:24:13Z: As discussed offline: lets land the simplest version first, without dropout or other complications.

Then we can aim to merge it prior to waiting for more downstream libraries. How about that?\n- IvyZX commented on 2024-02-06T22:29:35Z: What kind of downstream libraries are we waiting for? I can definitely add a disclaimer there, but if the blocker is downstream should we explain that (like, this new API doesn't work for bla bla cases)?\n- froystig commented on 2024-02-12T21:58:24Z: The challenge is that jax itself is backwards compatible by way of polymorphism: all `jax.random` functions accept both old- and new-style keys, and those that return keys (`split` and `fold_in`) do so based on what flavor of key they were given. Meanwhile, other libraries that deal with jax's keys might have not yet upgraded to new-style. If our docs encourage new-style keys to users, then those users might pass new-style keys to a library that doesn't understand the new style yet.\r\n\r\nI don't think anything is blocking this really, and my guess is that we only need disclaimers in our own docs for now.

There are ML packages built on top of JAX that may wish to include a utility routine like this, but we strive to keep JAX core relatively compact.\n- chrisflesher commented on 2023-08-19T19:54:23Z: Here is some discussion on dataloaders, each of these packages has some functionality to split datasets into train / test:\r\n`https://github.com/google/jax/discussions/16785`\n",

That approach gives strictly more control to users and library writers alike, and works well for e.g. NumPy array API priorities.\r\n\r\nNit: I don't think this really worked out great for NumPy's `__array_priority__`. Users basically picked priorities > 1 at random without any sense of how they could interact.\r\n\r\nNumPy's newer mechanism for overriding operations with NumPy arrays `__array_ufunc__` got rid of array priorities in favor of forcing users to explicitly choose how to handle every pair of array types. That would be a better model to emulate in my opinion (though I also think it's fine to just say \"inner policy wins\" in this case, since there is an ambiguous ordering).\n",

For every primitive, at least for those not\nparameterized by other computations, you can create a translation rule that\ncalls the existing HLO translation rule and translate its output. You can\nthen replace the rules one-by-one as you need. This should get you fairly\ncomplete coverage for a fairly low initial cost.\n\nSome of the translation rules aren't trivial. Not all JAX primitives are\none-to-one with HLO constructs. You can find the most interesting examples\nof this by searching for xla.lower_fun() which allows you to call back into\nthe tracing machinery in a translation rule: no-one wants to write\nnon-trivial code in the builder API so the non-trivial code typically uses\nthis facility to embed JAX code in a translation rule.

However, we could do some plumbing to use it as a bootstrap mechanism as Peter suggests (at a performance cost -- but fine if a means to an end and likely not a dominant cost on day 1 anyway). The taxes will accrue a bit and may not be worth it when considering that IREE operates on MHLO that has been significantly sanitized (de-tupleized, control flow flattening, etc). The passes that do that are in our XLA importer, not in the IREE compiler itself, and they undo things that are a consequence of fitting through the existing XLA surface area). All doable, but cost/benefit of re-use has to be weighed.\r\n\r\nI'll also point out that this is something like the 4th frontend that we've worked on, and a surface area the size of XlaBuilder is the least frightening of the things we've seen when considering the cost if it just needs to be replaced in full. In my experience, this is the size/scope of thing that you pick a new general purpose structure for and then migrate to over a few iterations vs spending a lot of time trying to leverage in-situ. I can't quite picture the exact API, but it would be really nice if JAX had more plugability for out-of-tree projects at this level.

Here is our iree-samples commit with it working: https://github.com/google/iree-samples/commit/d0f266a2bf0432e4ea71302c8c3b03b43c72cc9d\r\n\r\nThis is a toy implementation for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* Just marshalling through numpy ndarray vs using lower level buffers and avoiding copies.\r\n* Uses our HLO->MLIR utility which involves a lot of ASM munging and a process jump.\r\n* Hard-codes device setup and such (just for a single CPU).\r\n* Uses the synchronous Python API vs the lower level C-API, which allows for async dispatch and corresponding buffer lifetime, etc: If ever making this more than a quick way to evaluate IREE, probably want to drop down to C.\r\n\r\nI need to dive in and see how to redirect this away from its reliance on an XlaComputation. Maybe some kind of higher level hook that delegates to the normal Xla way (haven't grok'd the code at all).\n- hawkinsp commented on 2021-11-29T15:32:58Z: Closing this PR because I think the IREE and MHLO integration that are checked in replace it (e.g,.  https://github.com/google/jax/pull/8529 )\n",

My understanding is that it's intentional that `AbstractValue` has no shape or dtype, and this change seems like it's breaking a core abstraction of the tracing model. Not to mention the fact that having `UnshapedArray` inherit from `AbstractArray`-with-`shape` either makes the name incorrect, or breaks basic OOP assumptions around object attributes and inheritence.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there's a more consistent fix we could use here?\n- mattjj commented on 2024-09-06T16:26:41Z: This doesn't make sense because we can have non-arraylike types which don't have these attributes, like `AbstractToken` today and `AbstractTuple` in the past/future.\r\n\r\n> We assume that an AbstractValue is a ShapedArray in lots of places\r\n\r\nWe should instead revise those places, as they're mistaken!

What do you think?\n- Micky774 commented on 2024-04-22T15:49:40Z: > I think this is a case where we should follow numpy rather than following the Array API to the letter. There are many places where the array API is more restrictive than NumPy, which we've been taking our cue from up until this point. Deprecating previously supported behavior when NumPy still supports it will lead to undue downstream churn, so I think we should avoid it. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI would generally agree, however there are a few benefits for this that make me prefer the domain restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe domain restriction itself forces users to make an explicit decision regarding the transform they choose to use, pushing for using the most specific transform possible as opposed e.g. `fft` everything. Looking towards the scientific computing community, I think this by itself is a valuable aid, especially for folks that aren't familiar with the computational implications of `fft` vs say `rfft` or `hfft`.\r\n\r\nAlso, pulling from @kgryte who provided a helpful summary of some of the discussion that went into the decision from the consortium, both in meetings and in PRs (e.g. this [comment thread](https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/pull/720#discussion_r1423281070)):\r\n> in the spec, we've sided against implicit upcasting from real-to-complex, as users should be clear about what/how they want to cast. While a real-valued array can be interpreted as a complex array having omitted imaginary components which are all zero, this doesn't have to be the case. The array could be imaginary components or interleaved real and imaginary, etc. Particularly for the FFT APIs, certain transforms are very explicitly C2C or C2R transforms. In which case, providing a real-valued array is not the intent.\r\n\r\nAnd ultimately afaik NumPy 2.0 _will_ be implementing the domain restrictions, as `numpy.array_api.fft` already does and they intend for the general `numpy` namespace to be properly array API compatible, so we're just getting ahead of them on this one. We don't need to complete the deprecation until they've fully adopted it anyways, so we won't be fully diverging.\r\n\r\ncc: @pearu in case you have some opinions on this too\r\n\n- jakevdp commented on 2024-04-22T16:02:09Z: > And ultimately afaik NumPy 2.0 will be implementing the domain restrictions,\r\n\r\nDo you have a link to a NEP or other forum that discusses this?\n- Micky774 commented on 2024-04-22T17:00:36Z: Okay it looks like I had misinterpreted the word \"**should**\" in the array API spec to imply room for backwards compatibility _with the intent of deprecation_, given the changelog wording\r\n\r\n> `fft.fft`: **require** the input array to have a complex-valued floating-point data type\r\n\r\nhowever, that is not the case. As such, we are already compliant and this PR is not needed. Thanks for helping me catch that @jakevdp\n",

I believe this is because the original paper uses bitonic sort for GPU operations and a GPU merge path algorithm, while my repository currently relies on regular argsort.\r\n\r\nI came across this GitHub issue while searching for potential solutions. Given the current situation, I'm wondering about the best path forward:\r\n\r\n1. Should I wait for bitonic sort or a new JAX method that efficiently merges two sorted arrays?\r\n2. Would it be advisable to write my own Pallas kernel to address this?\r\n3. Are there any plans to update JAX to include more efficient sorting or merging algorithms for GPUs?\r\n\r\nAny insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

So it'd be good to have alternative solutions.

Since this PR is changing the overflow behavior, the fix would be to make sure it errors both with and without JIT.\n- mattjj commented on 2023-03-30T17:39:21Z: Dumping some state for posterity: in updating the test that failed, we found that this version failed _but did not fail with the two separate tests run individually_:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1458824/228918390-260d14dc-77f1-4521-bff8-5fdc2d2f42b5.png)\r\n\r\nWe don't like inter-dependency between test cases. Thinking that the inter-dependency was due to caching, I tried revising the test to introduce a fresh `lambda k: jax.random.PRNGKey(k)` for each case, and then run both with a cache-miss and a cache-hit. But that made the failures go away! I think there's some tricky interaction with the C++ path (which has its own cache, and which only gets hits for jax.Array inputs).\r\n\r\nMoreover I realized that the technique we use for detecting overflow when we pass builtin Python int types is a bit brittle: it depends on us inferring the JAX type of `x` (when `x` is an `int`) by doing `core.raise_to_shaped(core.get_aval(x))`, since the `core.get_aval(x)` is what does the check.\r\n\r\nSo we've got to do a bit more revision here...\n",

This is somewhat strange in the normal course of things, as it means `bcoo_extract()` and `bcoo_todense()` are not strict inverseses of each other when indices are duplicated, but this property does ensure that `bcoo_extract()` and `bcoo_todense()` are transposes of each other!\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the two inverses in special cases, while breaking the transpose property in those cases (which is relied on in the transpose rules for both functions).

The input should be symmetric/hermitian and not a random matrix.  If you agree, then let me know if the fix makes sense.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-12-14T22:02:53Z: Hi - thanks for looking into this! I think the test is fine as-is, because both `lax.linalg.tridiagonal` and `scipy.linalg.lapack.ssytrd` take an argument that specifies whether the lower or upper triangle is referenced, and the rest of the matrix will be ignored. Because of this, it's actually useful if the input matrix is not hermitian/symmetric, because otherwise the test would not detect if the `lower` argument is behaving incorrectly!\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I think we should keep the test as-is \u2013 what do you think?\n- rahulbatra85 commented on 2022-12-15T02:31:49Z: @jakevdp ok, I see your point about the lower flag, but what about the case where input matrix elements are complex numbers and some diagonal elements are not real. Is this a valid input? For example, something like this\r\n[[ 1+5j  2-j ]\r\n [ 4+j    5-j ]]\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-12-15T02:42:05Z: Yes, that input is valid. For complex inputs, the function discards the imaginary part of the diagonal, which you can confirm by testing on your input:\r\n```python\r\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\r\nfrom jax import lax\r\nx = jnp.array([[1+5j, 2-1j],\r\n               [4+1j, 5-1j]])\r\nfor output in lax.linalg.tridiagonal(x):\r\n  print(output)\r\n# [[ 1.       +0.j  2.       -1.j]\r\n#  [-4.1231055+0.j  5.       +0.j]]\r\n# [1. 5.]\r\n# [-4.1231055]\r\n# [1.9701426+0.24253564j]\r\n\r\nx2 = jnp.array([[1   , 2-1j],\r\n                [4+1j, 5   ]])\r\nfor output in lax.linalg.tridiagonal(x):\r\n  print(output)\r\n# [[ 1.       +0.j  2.       -1.j]\r\n#  [-4.1231055+0.j  5.       +0.j]]\r\n# [1. 5.]\r\n# [-4.1231055]\r\n# [1.9701426+0.24253564j]\r\n```\r\nThis behavior has test coverage because the test inputs are not symmetrized.\n- rahulbatra85 commented on 2022-12-15T13:41:39Z: ok, that makes sense now.

You can always come up with contraptions like this one. Our current implementation assumes that they keys have a total order, and your example violates that.\r\n\r\nAnd I think it's not only about the implementation. pytree flattening is about converting a nested data structure into a sequence, it is ill-defined to attempt to do that unless the elements of any given container can be given a total order.\n- XuehaiPan commented on 2022-08-12T12:38:06Z: > Our current implementation assumes that they keys have a total order\r\n\r\nI see. What if we sort by `key = (obj.__class__.__qualname__, obj)`? It will have a total order that `key[0]` is a string and is always comparable.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: sorted([0, 'a'])\r\nTypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'\r\n\r\nIn [2]: sorted([0, 'a'], key=lambda x: (x.__class__.__qualname__, x))\r\nOut[2]: [0, 'a']\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: This solution works for all Python built-in types. But it will not always work for user-defined classes overriding `__lt__` method either (in https://github.com/google/jax/pull/11871#issuecomment-1213055803). Because they have the same type (same `obj.__class__.__qualname__`):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [3]: sorted(tree1, key=lambda x: (x.__class__.__qualname__, x))\r\nOut[3]: [KeyType1(0), KeyType1(1)]\r\n\r\nIn [4]: sorted(tree2, key=lambda x: (x.__class__.__qualname__, x))\r\nOut[4]: [KeyType2(1), KeyType2(0)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user defined ordering `__lt__` / `__le__` / `__gt__` / `__ge__` should be ignored if we need to implement a total order.\r\n\n- XuehaiPan commented on 2023-06-23T10:02:50Z: Hi @apaszke, a gentle ping for this. The XLA upstream (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/57122#issuecomment-1538488523) would decide to review the corresponding change if this PR is also accepted.\r\n\r\nIs there any progress on this? For sortable keys, this PR is fully backward compatible. While for non-sortable keys, it sorts the keys by `key=lambda o: ('{0.__module__}.{0.__qualname__}'.format(o.__class__), o)` rather than raises a `TypeError`. If the JAX community thinks we need to raise an error when the keys are not directly comparable, I can close this PR.\n- XuehaiPan commented on 2023-08-28T07:25:51Z: Closing for now due to inactivity.\n",

My gut says we shouldn't start introducing this kind of special case in JAX's tracing behavior. It adds complexity to the implementation, adds mental overhead to thinking about how code executes, and may lead to strange corner cases where numpy array inputs behave differently than equivalent jax array inputs (because of differences in behaviors like type promotion, overflow semantics, etc. between JAX and numpy)\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-05-12T17:16:57Z: Nice explanation, I think it is good to keep this convention(avoid trace-time op on np array)!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a\r\nAvoid corner case is another important reason!!\r\nmore special case means more mental burden!!\n",

WDYT @jakevdp ?\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-18T21:45:58Z: But the downside of `object` is that if user use type checker and write something like `tile(x, 2) + 1`, where `x` is not a `ndarray`, then type checker will complain that `object` not support `+`. BUT I think this is intentioned, for example `PRNGKeyArray` doesn't support arithmetic. If I add `np.array` annotation, the only false postive is `__jax_array__`. (not sure it really works with `tile`)\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-04-20T16:29:18Z: So I'm still kind of hesitant on this. It seems like it's opening the door to add a lot of extra code (two overloads for every user-facing API function) with very little testing. I know in theory these annotations should be covered by running mypy on our source files, and/or perhaps our test suite, but my main experience with mypy in JAX is having to add `# type: ignore` in seemingly random places across the package in order to fix new false positives that arise  every time we update the mypy version used by our CI. It doesn't give me much confidence in the test coverage provided by mypy's static type checking.\r\n\r\nSo what this PR looks like to me is a proposal to eventually add hundreds of lines of untested type annotations to the API in a manner that makes it very likely the annotations will silently become out-of-date at some point in the future. It's not obvious to me that the benefits here outweigh the increased maintenance burden.\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-20T16:57:55Z: Okay, I can remove the \"overload for type annotation\" part in this PR because of the maintenance concern. What do you think about the rest of this PR? At least it will be very useful to have return-type annotation for `zeros`, `ones` and arithmetic operator on `ndarray`.\r\nNevertheless, Pytorch heavily uses stubs(`pyi`) for type annotation and has won lots of endorsement from users, which is almost the same as I do. The only difference is that they place the type annotation in a separate file.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-04-20T17:16:47Z: If another core maintainer feels differently and is willing to take ownership of this, I'd be fine with that!\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-04-20T19:21:46Z: Hi - thanks so much for sticking with a tough review process here \u2013 your comments & contribution here have been really helpful for me to learn more about some of the potential benefits of type annotations.\r\n\r\nWe've been having some offline conversation among the core team spurred by this, by #10321, and by other similar requests/contributions in the past. I think before we make any decision on this kind of thing we need to step back and do a more comprehensive look at the benefits & tradeoffs surrounding type annotations. With that in mind I think it would be best to table this contribution for now, until we can come up with a better roadmap for annotations within JAX as a whole.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound?\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-20T19:37:44Z: Thanks for your nice review&insight.

I'm a bit uncomfortable with the level of duplication here. I think rather than creating new protocols that mirror the existing classes, we should just annotate the existing classes as the return type. They're in underscored paths, but I think there are fewer downsides in that route than in the duplicative protocol route. What do you think?\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-04-07T19:45:20Z: (The downsides I'm thinking of mainly are obfuscation of the true types, the lack of testability of the correct mapping between the protocol and the class, the potential for duplicated docstrings to become out-of-sync, etc.)\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-07T20:35:03Z: I agree with you. Non-duplication and testability is important, while I think we can remove duplicated docstring. \r\nBut if we want to annotate the existing classes as the return type, how to resolve the cyclic import?\r\nlax_numpy.py import ndarray.py, while existing classes are in lax_numpy.py\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-04-08T14:48:27Z: Reading around, it seems that the cyclic import issue is a common problem for which there aren't any great solutions. Maybe the best is the idea of creating an abstract base class for the API that both the implementation and the protocol derive from, though to be honest I don't love that.\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-16T13:00:10Z: @jakevdp Okay I have a nice solution avoiding cyclic import in #10322\n",

It is true a direct call to `searchsorted` tend to have smaller query size, but for instance `vmap(jnp.digitize, in_axes=(0, None))` can generate a call with large query size.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-01-19T19:37:21Z: How large is \"large\" to you?\n- soraros commented on 2022-01-19T19:40:44Z: > How large is \"large\" to you?\r\n\r\nIndeed, that depends. Let's just say I ran your benchmark code with `len(query) == 10000` and the result doesn't look good for sort, and even worse for 100000, on the GPU. On the TPU, sort is clearly winning.\r\n![visualization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6129707/150204468-6bdfc2c0-207c-4120-a94f-4461140005f3.png)\r\n![visualization-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6129707/150204494-e58f7ced-b67a-4e2f-bd53-c90d0895b4d8.png)\r\n\r\n\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-01-19T20:00:00Z: Thanks - I updated the notebook. Looks like TPU clearly benefits from the sort method as the query grows, but GPU does not.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-01-19T20:10:42Z: I suspect performance tradeoffs here will likely depend on the size of the compute registers on the chip, which makes me think that achieving optimal performance will probably involve pushing the algorithmic choice here down to the XLA or MLIR compiler backend. That said, given the overall trend in these benchmarks we can probably default to `sort` on TPU and to `scan` on CPU/GPU. What do you think?\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-22T19:14:05Z: I think I'm going to close this. The sort-based algorithm is now available in  #11576, and it's not clear to me that the choice of algorithm can be made effectively at the level of a translation rule, so the primitive is probably too heavy-handed a solution for now (unless XLA grows a binary search operator, which would be very cool)\n",

We're constantly running into problems with the default fast-speed low precision TPU default as shown here for example: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/15754 .

No choice makes everyone happy.\r\n\r\nWould the `default_matmul_precision` config option solve your problem?\r\n\r\nIt can be set globally or as a decorator, e.g.\r\n```\r\n@jax.default_matmul_precision(\"float32\")\r\ndef f(...): ...\r\n```\n- mattjj commented on 2022-02-22T22:26:16Z: @patrickvonplaten thanks so much for that input. The feedback is really helpful, especially from HuggingFace.\n- patrickvonplaten commented on 2022-02-23T11:50:54Z: Thanks a lot for your feedback @hawkinsp and @mattjj ! The `default_matmul_precision`: `JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION=float32` global flag as @mattjj nicely explains [here](https://github.com/google/jax/pull/6143) nicely solves the problem, but you have to know that it exists **and** you have to know that the default precision is `bf16` for TPU. For our community and even people within Hugging Face, this is not intuitive really. \r\n\r\nTo give a bit more background, most of our Transformers users use PyTorch. More and more start looking into Flax/JAX + TPU now though because:\r\n- performance\r\n- Compared to PyTorch, there are arguably less gnarly bugs, the API is more intuitive for multi-TPU or multi-GPU settings of its performance and especially because multi-device settings and model/data parallelism works very well in is very intuitive (arguably much more than it is for PyTorch)\r\n\r\nNow IMO the reason because it's not intuitive is because:\r\n\r\n1. People come from PyTorch using GPU. They associate Flax/JAX with TPU and kind of transfer there PyTorch/GPU knowledge to the Flax/JAX TPU use case. So training scripts are run and the gradients explodes, loss is unstable -> if you don't know the difference between GPU/TPU and float32/bf16/fp16 it's not very straight-forward to find answers why the loss is unstable. I do think lots of people start using TPU expect that the precision is as high as possible and the code is optimized only when defined so by the user. E.g. `bfloat16` is not the default in PyTorch GPU, people have to define this themselves.\r\n\r\n2. The global flag `JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION` is great, but it's pretty hard to find out about this, e.g. when googling. For comparison if I google  \"set GPU device for PyTorch\", it's trivial to find the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` flag. However if I google \"Set precision for JAX TPU\", I'm not finding the \"JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION\" flag at all. I quickly see [this](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/1856) issue and https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/jax-quickstart-tpu-vm, but no where is this flag mentioned. I think there are people who at some point come to the conclusion that they have to specif icy the precision manually at every https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/flax.linen.Dense.html# module because they just don't know that this Flag exists. So somehow making this flag more prominent in the docs/issues is **really** important I think.\n- patrickvonplaten commented on 2022-02-23T11:54:19Z: Also pinging some community contributors here who frequently use JAX in combination with Flax on TPU - to give some feedback: @borisdayma @stefan-it\n- borisdayma commented on 2022-02-23T15:53:29Z: I was not aware of matmul precision flag, nor its default and whether it differs from Pytorch.\r\nI've been using the `dtype` argument from `flax.linen` modules, not sure if it's related\u2026\n- evanatyourservice commented on 2022-04-13T00:46:59Z: Hello! I've been following this discussion off and on and actually ran into this problem again today so I figured I'd add my +1.\r\n\r\nMy muzero implementation kept failing the past couple days and even though I knew about default_matmul_precision and its default being bfloat16, it still took me forever to figure out that this was the problem. It ended up needing tensorfloat32 or higher. I also ran into this problem a while ago training wavenets, which also needed tensorfloat32 or higher. It's common for folks to say that there is no difference between bfloat16 and float32, but in my experiments there has been a huge difference, and my belief that there was not much difference between the two only led to wasted time.\r\n\r\nMy opinion would be to at least set tensorfloat32 as the default, as this seems to be a nice compromise between speed and precision. If someone really wanted to eek more out of jax one way or another, either more speed or more precision, the other options could be found in the docs and implemented. Full float32 wouldn't be a bad choice either, as this would drastically lessen the chances of a problem being caused by the default precision. It may also help people to mention in the docs that there is in fact a difference between the precisions and that they can affect model performance. The TF bfloat16 docs only mention positives and say it is a drop-in replacement for float32, but as I gain experience with TPUs I believe this is simply flat out wrong.\n- MichaelHudgins commented on 2024-05-09T21:50:41Z: Closing Copybara created PR due to inactivity\n",

I changed the PR to handle empty iterators correctly.\n- mattjj commented on 2021-05-14T21:49:40Z: Thanks for looking for ways to improve JAX internals!\r\n\r\nBut I think there's some misunderstanding here: we're well aware of how `zip*` can be used, but `unzip2` and `unzip3` are specialized for good reasons, including whether they raise clear errors or fail silently:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: from jax._src.util import unzip2\r\n\r\nIn [2]: def new_unzip2(xys):\r\n   ...:     return tuple(zip(*xys)) or ((), ())\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [3]: unzip2([(1, 2), (3,)])\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-3-40905abf4923> in <module>\r\n----> 1 unzip2([(1, 2), (3,)])\r\n\r\n~/packages/jax/jax/_src/util.py in unzip2(xys)\r\n     44   xs = []\r\n     45   ys = []\r\n---> 46   for x, y in xys:\r\n     47     xs.append(x)\r\n     48     ys.append(y)\r\n\r\nValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)\r\n\r\nIn [4]: new_unzip2([(1, 2), (3,)])\r\nOut[4]: ((1, 3),)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't believe how many times that's saved us!\r\n\r\nSo in other words, having `unzip2` and `unzip3` with explicit, specialized implementations is quite intentional.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks again for looking for ways to improve! This isn't a spot to improve, but I'm sure there are many others.\n- mattjj commented on 2021-05-14T22:03:00Z: Maybe we should add a comment in the code here, like \"avoid using `zip(*...)` for better errors\"...\n- lgeiger commented on 2021-05-14T22:12:19Z: Yeah, sorry about that. This makes sense. I just stumbled upon this while trying to debug an unrelate issue on my side and though this might be simpler.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to change the code to\r\n```python\r\ndef new_unzip2(xys):\r\n     return tuple(safe_zip(*xys)) or ((), ())\r\n```\r\nwhich throws a nice `AssertionError: length mismatch: [2, 1]`. Otherwise we can just keep the PR closed.\n- mattjj commented on 2021-05-14T22:21:18Z: That might work, actually! That's a good idea. We should convince ourselves there are no other differences with the current `unzip2`, but maybe this covers it (edge cases and errors).\n- mattjj commented on 2021-05-14T22:38:31Z: (Sorry, I was wrong to close the issue so soon! As you showed, it turns out we just needed one more tweak to get what we needed with fewer lines.)\n- lgeiger commented on 2021-05-14T22:39:30Z: No worries at all, thanks for the blazing fast reviews \ud83d\ude80 \n- jakevdp commented on 2021-05-14T23:05:10Z: Quick thought: one alternative would be to add an optional `n=None` keyword parameter to `safe_zip`; if we define it appropriately then we could write\r\n```\r\ndef unzip2(vals):\r\n  return safe_zip(*vals, n=2)\r\n```\r\nand as a bonus, it would allow us to explicitly specify the number of expected elements in each argument to `safe_zip` where it would be useful.\n- mattjj commented on 2021-05-15T02:17:53Z: I think I prefer `unzip2` and `unzip3` to be spelled out over adding a kwarg to `safe_zip`.\r\n\r\nI think Jake is making the excellent point that this behavior isn't what we want:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: from jax._src.util import unzip2, safe_zip\r\n\r\nIn [2]: def new_unzip2(xys):\r\n   ...:     return tuple(safe_zip(*xys)) or ((), ())\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [3]: new_unzip2([(1,), (2,)])\r\nOut[3]: ((1, 2),)\r\n\r\nIn [4]: unzip2([(1,), (2,)])\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-4-ee726b410613> in <module>\r\n----> 1 unzip2([(1,), (2,)])\r\n\r\n~/packages/jax/jax/_src/util.py in unzip2(xys)\r\n     44   xs = []\r\n     45   ys = []\r\n---> 46   for x, y in xys:\r\n     47     xs.append(x)\r\n     48     ys.append(y)\r\n\r\nValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think I'm back to believing we are probably better off keeping things how they are (and closing this PR).

We could add a logic to not call this method for the seconds time in the liobrary, but basically it would be equivalent to this proposal. Maybe we could add a parameter \"fail_on_double_call\" and default to true?\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-05-11T22:15:53Z: Sorry to lose the thread on this.\r\n\r\nThinking about it more, in general calling `config_with_absl` twice is indicative of a larger problem with the script: it means the caller is expecting explicit configuration initialization in a place where it is not allowed. I think it would be better to continue raising an error in this case rather than to silence it. For your application, if you're certain that calling it twice is not problematic, perhaps you can check the state at the call site.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\n- qstanczyk commented on 2021-05-12T05:40:47Z: Sounds good, thanks.\n",

We represent these with names, distinct from \"positional\" axes, for a variety of reasons that I won't review here. Why change the type system? One of several reasons is to track the common action of our parallel primitives, independent of how their operation grounds out under any specific map (`pmap`, `vmap`, `xmap`, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis change takes the first step to that end, by making abstract evaluation aware of named axes. Now we need every abstract eval rule to propagate them. We can think of this as pulling an \"abstract\" version of each primitive's batching rule into its abstract eval rule. @jekbradbury actually proposes doing this automatically: partially evaluating the batching rules to extract abstract evaluations. We're not sure that this is necessary, nor that it cover primitives like `cond` that have non-default abstract evaluation rules, so we'll need to follow up on that either in this change or soon after it.\n",

There are some things, like the scan batching rule, that assume the scanned-over axis is always the leading one, and so e.g. it's [safe to place the batch axis as the second axis](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/81b7212cf9f67f26cac68e2465ab995ef4bd8d92/jax/lax/lax_control_flow.py#L1763).

I have an open TODO to include this in Haiku [link](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku/blob/30b2cb5ce29ea13fc75087146658ec158c007c0a/haiku/_src/recurrent.py#L177).

Cheers.\r\n\n- mattjj commented on 2021-06-17T22:49:51Z: Thanks for the pings. Sorry for the 6+ month delay time!\r\n\r\nThe blocker is adding thorough tests. I think the ideal tests would cover cases like scanning over different axis indices (maybe making the current test a parametrized test?), autodiff, and vmapping. I'm especially concerned about vmapping, because I suspect the `_scan_batching_rule` function may still assume that the scanned-over axis is the leading axis (though that's just a suspicion!). The file lax_vmap_test.py has some examples for how to write thorough vmap tests, which cover lots of combinations of axes for different arguments.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\n- hamzamerzic commented on 2021-08-06T16:17:51Z: Oh, I just realized I completely missed your message. That makes sense! I'll see if I can take a look at this next week. Thanks!\n- alonfnt commented on 2021-08-07T13:11:09Z: @hamzamerzic As it has been a while since I opened this PR, I cleaned a bit the commits and parametrized the current tests as Mathew suggested. Everything is currently working for the normal implementation, which is what I needed, but when I tried to parametrize the tests that deal with batching such as `testScanLinearize` and `testScanGrad`, I did get failing results which none of my attempts were able to fix. It seems that the reason is, as Mathews correctly guessed, the `_scan_batching_rule` function and its assumption of leading axis. \r\n\r\nYou are more than welcome to continue this PR or throw it all and start from scratch, whichever suits you better :smile: \n",

Recording my thoughts here for posterity, though we discussed more in our chat rooms. Not everyone agrees with the reasoning or conclusion here!\r\n\r\nI don't think we should merge this. My primary concern is that there are unforeseen edge cases that will end up harming usability on net. Once we merge a new api that users start relying on, if edge cases later emerge it may be difficult or impossible to revise our decision and remove it. It's possible that there are _no edge cases at all_ to this convenience layer, but the `tools.curry` logic [looks tricky enough](https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz/blob/ea3ba0d60a33b256c8b2a7be43aff926992ffcdb/toolz/functoolz.py#L300-L335) that it's not easy for me to make that claim without deeper investigation. To be confident, I'd want to thoroughly understand the `toolz.curry` logic, and still probably brainstorm and write tests for all the evil edge cases I can think up. That would take time, and I don't think the potential upside of this convenience layer justifies that kind of time investment given our other priorities.\r\n\r\nA distant secondary concern is performance. `jit` dispatch time isn't good now, but because it's relatively simple we know how to make it fast, and we've already started working on that. I don't want to add another wrapper from an external library to that path now, since it's another potential blocker to fast dispatch.\r\n\r\nThe current solution to the issue at hand here, with `@partial(jit, ...)`, is simple and predictable. It may be unfamiliar at first, but it's easy to learn and once learned it's easy to understand and predict its behavior. Moreover, any user who wants a curried version can get it as simple as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport toolz\r\nfrom jax import jit\r\n\r\njit = tools.curry(jit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, we don't need to bundle these things together for users. They can use composition instead.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't think we should merge this, I appreciate the time you put into making a concrete proposal we could debate. Without it, we wouldn't have been able to weigh alternatives! Investigating this carefully made JAX better.\n",

The phase freedom of complex entries makes numeric eigenvector gradient checking a bit more complicated than just using `check_grads`.\n- j-towns commented on 2020-05-13T09:48:11Z: Yeah indeed. I've dug into the implementation details of eig and it seems the 'phase freedom' is actually constrained by setting the largest element (in absolute value) of each eigenvector to be real, thus the output of `(np|jnp).linalg.eig` is actually uniquely determined.\r\n\r\nHowever it's questionable whether we should implement gradients that cater to that specific choice of constraint, since it's pretty arbitrary, and it feels like users shouldn't be depending on it in their code...\r\n\r\nSome discussion on this towards the bottom of #2748.

I want the same thing for iterative linear solvers like conjugate gradients.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, you are putting the evaluation counter in the cotangents? Is is possible to get this information out if you're using `odeint` as part of a larger function on which you're calling `grad`? It feels like we might need a more comprehensive solution here. Right now my guess is that this wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if we ever might want to return other metadata from the solver, like the chosen timesteps. Some of these fields could have a float dtype, but they won't have valid derivatives defined -- at least that could be computed without differentiating through the solver itself, which the entire point of these custom gradient rules is to avoid. It seems like we really should have some way of indicating such terms are \"non-differentiable\".\n- jacobjinkelly commented on 2020-04-02T02:58:14Z: Yes, I'm putting the evaluation counter in the cotangents. To get the information out of the grad of a larger function (call it `f`) using `odeint`, you must call `_odeint_wrapper` instead and thread a dummy argument through `f` and `_odeint_wrapper` . If you take grad wrt that dummy argument you get the auxiliary information. Essentially I'm putting auxiliary information in place of a derivative wrt the dummy argument. You can see in an example in `pend_get_nfe` in the PR.\r\n\r\nI totally agree that this solution won't work in general, and what we really need is a general option for a vjp to return auxiliary information which is separate from the auxiliary information returns with the primals on the forward pass.\n- samuela commented on 2020-04-24T18:14:58Z: This PR makes me wonder: What is the idiomatic approach to handling auxiliary data/results in JAX, both in terms of primal functions and their vjp's? \r\n\r\nI'm in roughly the same boat as @jacobjinkelly... I also need to get auxiliary results out of `odeint`, but it's not clear what the right approach to doing so is.\n- samuela commented on 2020-04-24T21:37:54Z: Getting auxiliary info out of vjps seems like the messier of the two problems. Like how would it work with `value_and_grad`? And what about higher-order gradients etc etc...\n- mattjj commented on 2020-04-24T22:15:24Z: I am wondering the same, @samuela. Thoughts welcome, though @jekbradbury has led an internal group brainstorming about this (e.g. including Flax and Haiku folks) and it's very tricky.\n- samuela commented on 2020-04-24T22:38:57Z: @mattjj I really haven't thought this through yet! But this seems like the right use case for something like algebraic effects: Code can be instrumented by adding effects for the values of interest and then it's up to client code to register effect handlers for the things they care about. This way effects do not get in the way of function return types and users can be selective in the information they want, and how it should be processed. Presumably some people just want to log debug info, others may want to record it, etc.\r\n\r\nThe challenge I foresee in such a system would be getting this to play nicely with XLA which presents a bit of a challenge. XLA has only limited support for side effects. Custom calls are one option but they'd be incredibly slow if you have to jump back out into Python in the middle of a hot loop. Perhaps there could be some way to trace effects and their handlers? XLA is great for speedy numerical code, but it does makes this all a little tricky.\n- shoyer commented on 2020-04-24T23:03:14Z: > The challenge I foresee in such a system would be getting this to play nicely with XLA which presents a bit of a challenge.

I should've noted that this PR is a bit of a draft at the moment, and so I'm looking for early feedback.\r\n\r\n> Why were the constants hoisted out of the computation in the first place? Is that reason still applicable?\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a good reason; it was just an artifact of the first way we wrote things.\r\n\r\nOne benefit we realized after the fact is that it automatically had the effect of avoiding staging into XLA a large constant into both a subcomputation (like in a while_loop) and the computation that contains it. I may try to solve that more directly on this PR.\r\n\r\n> The motivation and the solution seem to not match.\r\n\r\nCan you say more? They seem to match in my head, but maybe I didn't explain it well!\n- gnecula commented on 2020-02-11T19:46:42Z: > > The motivation and the solution seem to not match.\r\n> \r\n> Can you say more? They seem to match in my head, but maybe I didn't explain it well!\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was that the problem to solve is to better control how pmap broadcasts inputs and outputs. This suggests that the solution should be some control mechanism for pmap broadcasting. Incidentally, it seems that we now have the mechanism through the `mapped_invars`. \r\n\r\nInstead this solution is changing how we trace Python into Jaxpr and changes even how Jaxpr looks. This could have broader consequences, and also introduces a hidden dependency of pmap on how we trace constants. This reminds me very much of the freevars and how pmap was implicitly taking advantage of them, but it was not possible to see this unless you try to remove freevars. \n- mattjj commented on 2020-02-11T20:03:11Z: I agree that if we had both mapped_invars _and_ mapped_outvars that would give us another way of solving this. That\u2019s what I pointed out when I wrote \u201cAn alternative solution would be...\u201d Indeed that\u2019s the first solution I thought of!\r\n\r\nBut that solution is heavyweight for this particular issue. Unless we have a good reason to plumb constants as outputs of a pmap, why not revise that instead? And indeed this is a revision to jaxprs, like we\u2019ve been doing a lot of recently :) (I might try removing constants entirely now...)\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t introducing a dependency of pmap on how we handle constants; you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t change the pmap code, but instead I just changed which things are hoisted as constants versus literals and everything kept working. We could flip a coin to decide whether to treat each value as a hoisted constant or a literal and it would still work. But it\u2019s preferable to treat things as literals because it\u2019s more efficient, hence the PR. \r\n\r\nCan you think of any reasons to prefer the constant-hoisting behavior?\r\n\n- mattjj commented on 2020-02-11T20:06:10Z: (By the way, handling a pmap with mapped_outvars is tricky because, for example, when doing jvp or partial eval we don\u2019t know until we run the function how many outputs there will be. It\u2019s doable but much heavier than anything in this PR!)\n- gnecula commented on 2020-02-11T21:43:15Z: To be clear, if you say there were no important reasons to hoist constants, I like the change. If we can remove hoisted consts, I think that Jaxpr will be even simpler :-) \r\n\r\nI see that you did not change the code for pmap, yet you fixed how it behaves. This suggests that the dependency is implicit. I would have thought that with or without hoisting the semantics should be the same. \n- gnecula commented on 2020-02-12T13:46:52Z: If you do agree to try to remove the constvars, then I'd be happy to do that. I assume that some work would be needed for the linearity-bitmaps for scan and while, and also maybe something for compilation (perhaps hoisting them out only for compilation)?\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-09T00:47:35Z: Closing, as non-scalar literals are now supported!\n",

At least, we won't face grad issue of `x = max(x, 0) + min(x, 0)`. :D I found the definition helpful for [cross_entropy_with_logits](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits), where the function is `max(x, 0) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))`, which involves both `max` and `abs`. With `grad max(x,y) = 0.5`, the gradient of `cross_entropy` at (0, 0) will be correct.\n- joaogui1 commented on 2020-02-22T21:48:48Z: If we use let the grad of min(0, 0) = 0.0 the first part is a non-issue I believe, but indeed getting the correct grad for cross-entropy is extremely important. \r\nBummer, I wonder if there's a definition of the grad that works for all the cases.\r\nIn any case, the original problem this PR was meant to fix is going to be fixed by a custom grad and as you pointed out I would end up breaking other stuff, so I'm closing this, thanks for the input!\n- yingted commented on 2020-03-09T23:34:00Z: I think there's a definition of grad that's consistent with the C/NumPy functions, if we ignore NaN:\r\nmax(x,y) = the larger one, or x if they're equal\r\nabs(x) = x if x>0 or x is +0, otherwise -x\r\nThen, max(-0,0) = -0, max(0,-1) = 0, and abs(-0) = 0.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that it probably breaks even more things.\r\nYou can still do many things, but not as easily:\r\n- (min(x,y), max(x,y)) becomes (min(x,y), max(y,x))  (stable sort)\r\n- max(x,0) + min(x,0) becomes max(x,0) + min(0,x)  (same as above, y=0)\r\n- (min(x,y), abs(x-y)) becomes (min(x,y), max(y,x)-min(x,y))\n",

This is tricky stuff (I remember from [playing with this in Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/blob/c6f630a5ec18bd30f1485bc0dbbccb8664c77510/autograd/differential_operators.py#L149-L190), though that had to be Python 2-compatible), and it's worth exploring.\r\n\r\nMaybe the goal could be something like: either find a sound-but-not-complete approach to map keyword arguments to positional parameters, or else identify once and for all the reason we can't. WDYT?\r\n\r\nAlso, what do you think about just using `inspect.signature(f).bind(*args, **kwargs).args`? That seems to handle some simple cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [2]: inspect.signature(lambda x, y: x + y).bind(y=2, x=3).args\r\nOut[2]: (3, 2)\r\n\r\nIn [3]: inspect.signature(lambda x, y: x + y).bind(2, y=3).args\r\nOut[3]: (2, 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could throw in some `apply_defaults` if we want:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [5]: ba = inspect.signature(lambda x, y=3: x + y).bind(2)\r\n\r\nIn [6]: ba.apply_defaults()\r\n\r\nIn [7]: ba.args\r\nOut[7]: (2, 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIIUC that would already let us handle more cases than we do now, since it effectively turns more args into positional ones.\r\n\r\nI'd like to red-team this to make sure we can never be misled by reasonable metadata values though, and produce silently wrong results... Is there any way to make a wrapper that would, instead of just obscuring the signature (causing us to error when keyword arguments are passed), actually make us bind incorrect values? Or is that only possible with malicious setting of `__wrapped__` or something like that?\n- mattjj commented on 2020-01-28T06:12:15Z: Ah, I misread the code, maybe using `sig.bind` is exactly your strategy; I didn't understand the need for the rest of the code (ie why define `_fun`), but maybe it's to handle keyword-only args (which are new to me, coming from py2).\r\n\r\n(I should have read your PR comment first, but instead I just looked at the code ;) )\n- mattjj commented on 2020-01-28T06:22:18Z: By the way, linear_util.py already supports keyword arguments everywhere AFAIK.\r\n\r\n+1 to profiling this. Perhaps we only need to call into this when keyword arguments are actually used.\r\n\r\nAlso +1 to raising errors: we don't need to have a complete solution, and just handling more cases than we currently do would be an improvement!\r\n\r\nHere's one way we might write this in a linear_util.py style:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom inspect import signature\r\nfrom functools import partial\r\n\r\nfrom jax import jit\r\nimport jax.linear_util as lu\r\n\r\ndef make_args_positional(f):\r\n  return _make_args_positional(lu.wrap_init(f), signature(f)).call_wrapped\r\n\r\n@lu.transformation\r\ndef _make_args_positional(sig, *args, **kwargs):\r\n  ba = sig.bind(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  ba.apply_defaults()\r\n  ans = yield ba.args, ba.kwargs\r\n  yield ans\r\n\r\n@make_args_positional\r\n@partial(jit, static_argnums=(1,))\r\ndef f(x, y):\r\n  return x + y\r\n\r\nf(2, y=3)  # fails if @make_args_positional is removed\r\n\r\n@make_args_positional\r\n@partial(jit, static_argnums=(1,))\r\ndef g(x, y, **kwargs):\r\n  return x + y + kwargs['z']\r\n\r\ng(2, y=3, z=2)  # works b/c we make enough args positional\r\n\r\n@make_args_positional\r\n@partial(jit, static_argnums=(1,))\r\ndef h(x, **kwargs):\r\n  return x + kwargs['y'] + kwargs['z']\r\n\r\nh(2, y=3, z=2)  # raises same error as usual\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Making it an extra transformation this way might even be useful as an API, to make it opt-in behavior, though I'm not sure that's a good idea.)\n- ziyadedher commented on 2020-01-28T13:50:04Z: @mattjj Thanks for taking a look at this! Yes, the reason I had to make a new function was to get around the keyword-only argument issue; however, doing that breaks the caching system since we are now constructing a new function object at every `jit` call and using that as our `jitted` function. To get around this, I used a very hacky wrapper class that emulates (to the greatest extent possible in vanilla Python) the inputted function while still converting the arguments correctly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  class Fun:\r\n    def __init__(self, fun):\r\n      self.fun = fun\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, *args):\r\n      fun_params = list(fun_sig.parameters.values())\r\n      new_args = []\r\n      new_kwargs = {}\r\n      for arg, param in zip(args, fun_params):\r\n        if param.kind is inspect.Parameter.KEYWORD_ONLY:\r\n          new_kwargs[param.name] = arg\r\n        else:\r\n          new_args.append(arg)\r\n      return self.fun(*new_args, **new_kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def __hash__(self):\r\n      return hash(self.fun)\r\n\r\n    def __eq__(self, other):\r\n      return self.fun == other\r\n\r\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\r\n      if name == \"fun\":\r\n        return super().__getattribute__(\"fun\")\r\n      else:\r\n        return self.fun.__getattribute__(name)\r\n\r\n    def __getattribute__(self, name):\r\n      if name == \"__init__\":\r\n        return functools.partial(Fun.__init__, self)\r\n      elif name == \"__call__\":\r\n        return functools.partial(Fun.__call__, self)\r\n      elif name == \"__hash__\":\r\n        return functools.partial(Fun.__hash__, self)\r\n      elif name == \"__eq__\":\r\n        return functools.partial(Fun.__eq__, self)\r\n      else:\r\n        return Fun.__getattr__(self, name)\r\n  _fun = Fun(fun)\r\n```\r\nHowever, this then raised a new issue where since we are using a `WeakKeyRef` dictionary and the instance of this class is created within the `jit` function, all strong references are lost and the function is dropped from cache anyway.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI will be playing around with the code example you gave today and see where it takes me, it's probably a lot less fragile than the current approach.\n",

I would start with your last question: what kind of performance tests we need? And then we decide what is a good way to get there. \r\n\r\nI think that we need both microbenchmarks (of the kind that you have created) and also larger benchmarks (e.g., how long it takes to train a certain model to a certain precision).

What tools were used for XLA?\n- joaogui1 commented on 2020-02-03T21:55:17Z: So, I believe given #2143 this PR seems more important now, so pinging @gnecula \n- mattjj commented on 2020-04-22T21:34:44Z: Thanks for starting this! I'm just paging it in again now, and asked some other folks whether asv makes sense for microbenchmarks for us. @shoyer and @jakevdp seem to think so!\r\n\r\nWe probably want to use [`block_until_ready`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html) right?\n- mattjj commented on 2020-04-22T21:56:57Z: Maybe we can separate out two questions:\r\n1. What benchmark harness should we use? asv seems to make sense now, but also perhaps this is easy to change later as needed, so it's a Type 2 decision (in the Jeff Bezos sense).\r\n2. What should we start with in our microbenchmark suite? We should probably think about what each thing is measuring.\r\n\r\nThe former I'm not too concerned about. On the latter, I wonder if we can try to come up with a rationale for each test, and only commit ones that have some rationale behind them. For example, some things to measure and track are:\r\n\r\n1. jit versus op-by-op dispatch times (say directly calling some `lax` primitives, like `lax.add`), since the latter has a special-case path only for performance reasons\r\n2. cache hit versus cache miss cases for the above\r\n3. numpy.ndarray aguments versus jax DeviceArray arguments to jitted functions\r\n4. some key numpy functions of interest to which we might want to apply jit or otherwise look into speeding up\r\n5. overheads from dtype and shape promotion logic\r\n\r\n(I'm setting aside pmap and ShardedDeviceArray ideas because those may be harder to meaningfully test in OSS.)\r\n\r\nThose might not be the right rationales, but perhaps we can iterate here. What signals do we want to track out of this? Avoiding regressions? Monitoring progress for specific overheads we've identified and want to improve on? (Keep in mind I'm focused on microbenchmarks only in this comment.)\n- mattjj commented on 2020-04-22T21:59:35Z: This might give us an alternative to asv: https://github.com/google/benchmark/pull/957. I need to learn more from our Google / DM colleagues about it. Will report back when I do!\n",

The PR contains N/A commits, with 0 additions and 0 deletions across 0 files. \n\nBody: No description available\n\nComments:\n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-05T20:48:12Z: For the gradient, I would suggest following the model of the iterative solver test for custom_linear_solve:\r\nhttps://github.com/google/jax/blob/0c0137d787830d8ebd584c4610f7932f3787cab6/tests/lax_control_flow_test.py#L1307-L1318\r\n\r\nConjugate gradients inverts positive symmetric matrices, so this would look something like:\r\n```python\r\n    def _cg_solve(matvec, b):\r\n      # your existing cg function, written with lax.while_loop\r\n\r\n    def cg(matvec, b):\r\n      # exposed as scipy.sparse.cg\r\n      return lax.custom_linear_solve(matvec, b, _cg_solve, symmetric=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy other suggestion would be to write to write this in terms of a function that calculates matrix-vector products. For dense matrices, other methods like Cholesky factorization are usually more efficient. CG really shines for inverting very large but sparse systems of equations, e.g., where the dense matrix might have 1e6 x1e6 elements, which is too big to fit into memory.\n- TuanNguyen27 commented on 2019-12-06T03:13:52Z: @shoyer thanks for the suggestions! My vanilla implementation is also missing a preconditioner, which can be diag(A), approx Cholesky factorization of A or other complicated choices. scipy's implementation has one but I couldn't figure out what it is from the source code. Do I need this in order to take advantage of the sparsity, instead of doing full matrix multiplication like what I have right now ? re: matrix-vector products, I thought there's no matrix inversion involved in my code...but I could be wrong :D \n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-06T08:11:06Z: Preconditioning can be very useful, but it isn't necessary for basic usage. Let's save it for a follow up.\r\n\r\nI was being a little sloppy with my language. CG does a linear solve rather than inverting a matrix (but in practice, it's very common to do linear solves instead of matrix inverses). \n- TuanNguyen27 commented on 2019-12-09T06:23:53Z: @shoyer I think i got my function into the right form that uses `matvec` instead of the explicit matrix `A`. However, with the function signature of `lax.custom_linear_solve` I won't be able to override the default of `x0`, `tol`, `maxiter` like `scipy.sparse.linalg.cg`. Does this matter ? Also, where should I put the test for this ? :D \n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-09T08:09:49Z: You can pass a lambda function or use functions.partial to handle the extra arguments.\n- TuanNguyen27 commented on 2019-12-09T18:09:56Z: > You can pass a lambda function or use functions.partial to handle the extra arguments.\r\n\r\nThanks, @shoyer ! what about the unit-test, should i add it to `lax_scipy_test.py` ? \n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-09T18:25:11Z: > what about the unit-test, should i add it to `lax_scipy_test.py` ?\r\n\r\nSure, this would be fine. You could also make a new test module for `scipy.sparse.linalg`, often that is a bit more obvious :).\n- TuanNguyen27 commented on 2019-12-09T18:30:38Z: > Sure, this would be fine.

Move the definition of `body_fun` inside `_cg_solve`, so you can omit the `matvec` argument and rely on the value from the outer scope.\r\n2. Partially apply `matvec` to `body_fun` and use that inside the argument to `while_loop`, e.g., use `functools.partial(body_fun, matvec)`\n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-20T18:30:30Z: Please post the error message here\n\nOn Fri, Dec 20, 2019 at 10:07 AM Tuan Nguyen <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> *@TuanNguyen27* commented on this pull request.\n> ------------------------------\n>\n> In jax/experimental/sparse.py\n> <https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1821#discussion_r360501612>:\n>\n> > +  N = np.shape(b)[0]\n> +  if x0 is None:\n> +    x_k = np.zeros_like(b)\n> +  else:\n> +    x_k = x0\n> +    if not np.shape(x0) == (N,):\n> +      raise ValueError('A and x have incompatible dimensions')\n> +    if maxiter is None:\n> +      maxiter = N*10\n> +  r_k = b - matvec(x_k)\n> +  r_k_norm = np.linalg.norm(r_k)\n> +  p_k = r_k\n> +  k = 0\n> +  full_tol = tol * np.linalg.norm(b)\n> +  p_k, x_k, r_k, r_k_norm, k = lax.while_loop(\n> +      lambda r_k_norm, k: (r_k_norm < full_tol) & (k < maxiter),\n>\n> I'm running into another error that I don't know how to solve, could you\n> please take a look @shoyer <https://github.com/shoyer> :)\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1821?email_source=notifications&email_token=AAJJFVSCLTEYWMCWKPKWGPLQZUCUTA5CNFSM4JV5RJ3KYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFWFIHK3DMKJSXC5LFON2FEZLWNFSXPKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOCP7DODY#discussion_r360501612>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAJJFVQU4KPBV7SGQTRJ6BDQZUCUTANCNFSM4JV5RJ3A>\n> .\n>\n\n- TuanNguyen27 commented on 2019-12-20T19:08:59Z: > Please post the error message here\r\n\r\nah yes, my apologies here's the error\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests/lax_scipy_sparse_test.py:50: in build_and_solve\r\n    return sparse.cg(matvec=matvec, b=b, maxiter=maxiter)\r\njax/experimental/sparse.py:65: in cg\r\n    x = lax.custom_linear_solve(matvec, b, cg_solve, symmetric=True)\r\njax/lax/lax_control_flow.py:1229: in custom_linear_solve\r\n    partial(solve, matvec), in_args_tree, b_avals)\r\njax/lax/lax_control_flow.py:60: in _initial_style_jaxpr\r\n    jaxpr, out_pvals, consts = pe.trace_to_jaxpr(fun, in_pvals, instantiate=True)\r\njax/interpreters/partial_eval.py:333: in trace_to_jaxpr\r\n    jaxpr, (out_pvals, consts, env) = fun.call_wrapped(pvals)\r\njax/linear_util.py:153: in call_wrapped\r\n    ans = self.f(*args, **dict(self.params, **kwargs))\r\njax/experimental/sparse.py:64: in <lambda>\r\n    cg_solve = lambda matvec, b: _cg_solve(matvec, b, x0, tol, maxiter)\r\njax/experimental/sparse.py:56: in _cg_solve\r\n    (p_k, x_k, r_k, r_k_norm, k)\r\njax/lax/lax_control_flow.py:192: in while_loop\r\n    cond_jaxpr, cond_consts, cond_tree = _initial_style_jaxpr(cond_fun, in_tree, init_avals)\r\njax/lax/lax_control_flow.py:60: in _initial_style_jaxpr\r\n    jaxpr, out_pvals, consts = pe.trace_to_jaxpr(fun, in_pvals, instantiate=True)\r\njax/interpreters/partial_eval.py:333: in trace_to_jaxpr\r\n    jaxpr, (out_pvals, consts, env) = fun.call_wrapped(pvals)\r\njax/linear_util.py:153: in call_wrapped\r\n    ans = self.f(*args, **dict(self.params, **kwargs))\r\njax/experimental/sparse.py:54: in <lambda>\r\n    lambda x: (x[-2] < full_tol) & (x[-1] < maxiter),\r\njax/core.py:304: in __lt__\r\n    def __lt__(self, other): return self.aval._lt(self, other)\r\njax/numpy/lax_numpy.py:464: in fn\r\n    x1, x2 =  _promote_args(numpy_fn.__name__, x1, x2)\r\njax/numpy/lax_numpy.py:279: in _promote_args\r\n    _check_arraylike(fun_name, *args)\r\nfun_name = 'less'\r\nargs = (Traced<ShapedArray(int64[]):JaxprTrace(level=1/0)>, None), pos = 1\r\narg = None\r\nmsg = '{} requires ndarray or scalar arguments, got {} at position {}.'\r\n    def _check_arraylike(fun_name, *args):\r\n      \"\"\"Check if all args fit JAX's definition of arraylike (ndarray or scalar).\"\"\"\r\n      if _any(not _arraylike(arg) for arg in args):\r\n        pos, arg = next((i, arg) for i, arg in enumerate(args)\r\n                        if not _arraylike(arg))\r\n        msg = \"{} requires ndarray or scalar arguments, got {} at position {}.\"\r\n>       raise TypeError(msg.format(fun_name, type(arg), pos))\r\nE       TypeError: less requires ndarray or scalar arguments, got <class 'NoneType'> at position 1.\r\n```\r\nEssentially, `r_k_norm`, `k` returned from `lax.while_loop` are `None` and it makes `lambda x: (x[-2] < full_tol) & (x[-1] < maxiter)` invalid. \n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-20T19:24:21Z: You need to set the initial values passed into the loop with valid arrays of the same dtype/shape as set inside the loop.

For the former, you could still get the primals if you wanted to if a `value_and_jvp` function was available.\r\n\r\nWith only reading the text above, here are the semantics I might expect. By default, primitives should simply propagate intermediates, i.e., identity on intermediates (which I believe is the case here), but I agree that what higher order operators should do is less clear. I think if you say that differentiation wipes all intermediates, you might get jvps returning only tangent intermediates while if you say that differentiation propagates intermediates, you would likely get jvp returning both primal and tangent. It's not quite clear what kind of low-level rule might lead to only getting intermediates of the primals.\r\n\r\nThere are probably lots of edge cases/caveat that I've missed but I thought sharing my first impressions will probably provide a better approximation of what a new user might think.\r\n\r\n> Similarly, I think the right thing to do in inject/collect of vmap is to accept/return batched intermediate values with the batch dimension in the vmap's out_dim, but that might be a little surprising for inject. (The current behavior of this code is to collect only the primal values in a jvp trace and to collect the batching tracers themselves in batching traces).\r\n\r\nAre you talking about when inject is used within a batched function? In that case, would batching inject be problematic?\n- mgbukov commented on 2020-03-18T16:52:53Z: @jekbradbury are you planning to merge these features into master eventually?\n- ethanluoyc commented on 2020-05-01T14:26:21Z: It would be great if this gets merged at some point.

That is, we didn't want to talk about chunks. We can always recover the \"chunked\" operation by using a reshape.\r\n\r\nMore generally, the semantics of our `pmap` collectives can't exactly match XLA's because with `pmap` the parallel axis is fully mapped and identified with a name, while with XLA there is no concept of mapped axis. This difference is especially salient in this `all_to_all` primitive, which effectively transposes mapped and logical (positional) axes with one another.\r\n\r\nBefore diving into any implementation details, let's figure out what design we want, and work out some examples. Do you have some examples of computations you want to express?\n- levskaya commented on 2021-01-06T01:32:30Z: this was fixed by PR #4388 \n",

I'll take a look when I can.\r\n\r\n@MostafaDehghani Usually when you are looking for that kind of transpose operation, you can use the reverse-mode gradient, or VJP.\r\n\r\n`jax.vjp` should let you do what you need here: use `jax.vjp` on `extract_image_patches` with a cotangent containing the image patches to sum. If there are overlapping image patches, the VJP will sum the contributions all of them. To take the mean, which I assume is what you want, you can use `jax.vjp` with a cotangent of all 1s to count the number of contributions to each pixel, then divide the sum by the count. Hope that helps!\n- MostafaDehghani commented on 2019-10-07T08:20:03Z: Hi, \r\n\r\nJust for the record, wanted to post this small example of how to reconstruct the original image given the output of extract_image_patches using  jax.vjp. \r\n\r\n```\r\nim_height = im_width = 6\r\npatch_height = patch_width = 2\r\nim = np.arange(im_height * im_width).reshape(-1, im_height, im_width,1).astype(np.float32)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef i2p(im):\r\n  return extract_image_patches(\r\n          lhs=im.astype(np.float64),\r\n          rhs_shape=(1,patch_height, patch_width,1),\r\n          window_strides=(1,patch_height, patch_width,1), \r\n          padding='VALID',\r\n          rhs_dilation=(1,1,1,1),\r\n          data_format='NHWC')\r\n\r\ndef p2i(im_patched):\r\n    _, fn_vjp = jax.vjp(i2p, np.ones(im.shape))\r\n    overlap_count = fn_vjp(np.ones_like(im_patched))[0]\r\n    return fn_vjp(im_patched)[0] / overlap_cou\r\n\r\nim_patched = i2p(im).squeeze()\r\nrecunstructed_im = p2i(im_patched)\r\nassert np.array_equal(recunstructed_im, im)\r\n```\r\nThanks  again @hawkinsp for the help! :)\n- gehring commented on 2020-10-12T21:36:02Z: This PR is no longer relevant given a more polished version is actively being worked on (#4459).\n",

Super clean, too.\r\n\r\nThat first issue definitely sounds like a `custom_transforms` issue, though I think a known/intended one: defining a VJP, rather than a JVP and/or a transpose directly, is just done by creating a dummy JVP object. So by defining the VJP here you're clobbering the JVP rule you wrote.\r\n\r\nI think the best approach, if we can make the math work out how we want, would be to define a JVP and a transpose rule here. After all, a VJP is just a JVP bundled together with partial evaluation and transposition; if we can decompose them we'll be in business, and possibly have less code to boot. (Or if we discover there are cases that we can't effectively decompose the VJP into a JVP and a transpose, and this is one of them, we'll have to figure out a different technique!)\r\n\r\n(FYI I'm traveling for a few more days and hence low bandwidth, but I'd love to help with this!)\n- shoyer commented on 2019-07-30T22:27:50Z: My benchmarks here were mistaken because I was not accounting for async dispatch.

We could write a check as a function only of dtypes (rather than values), but it looks like the point of the check is to ensure that all the values of `to_begin` are representable in the difference dtype. My recommendation is just to skip that check entirely, unless it is much more important than I'm currently appreciating.\r\n\r\nFor your second issue, are you asking whether it's possible to check if one dtype can exactly represent another? If so, I'm not totally sure, but `onp.issubdtype` seems relevant.\r\n\r\nTo check for exception raising, we don't yet have a way to check that the exception raised is the same as numpy's.

There's no reason the params tree has to be a tree of tuples, it could easily be a tree of dicts or wrapped tuples like yours with named params and layers, which enable manual access or even allowing a simple subtree query syntax for grabbing or selecting+modifying parts... all while still mostly enforcing the simple discipline of a stax layer as a init, apply tuple.

I'm not sure whether the XLA folks also plan to drop the non-status-returning API: if they were to do that, you would have to migrate. But this PR by itself doesn't do that. I'll ask them!\n- PhilipVinc commented on 2022-03-30T21:48:28Z: Thanks! It would be great to have some warning if you plan on dropping that API. I know your internal hooks are unstable, but if we can have some notice we can update in time to give very little disruption to users.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2022-03-30T21:52:23Z: I think we *will* drop the old API, but it turns out it's actually impossible for you to use the new API correctly outside JAX at the moment, so it will not be immediate. We will try to give you adequate time to migrate when it's ready.\n- PhilipVinc commented on 2022-03-31T08:56:25Z: Cc @dionhaefner\n- dionhaefner commented on 2022-03-31T09:05:41Z: Guess we should buckle up then :grimacing: \n",

You solved the particular case I mentioned, but I think it's certainly possible that if `abstract_i` won't have a `dtype` attribute even if `i` is `None`. That check is a bit of an \"action at a distance\" \u2013 it makes assumptions about the relationship between the two variables that is difficult for the reader of the code to ascertain without searching elsewhere in the file. That's kind of an antipattern, because it makes the code brittle and harder to maintain.\r\n\r\nWhat about something like this instead?\r\n```python\r\n       raise IndexError(\"Indexing mode not yet supported. Got unsupported indexer \"\r\n                        f\"at position {idx_pos}: {i}\")\r\n```\n- curlup commented on 2024-03-15T16:53:51Z: Sure, totally makes sense, should've thought of that myself \r\n(PS I wonder if there could be like a guiding doc for stuff like that.

There will likely be a lot of work required to land a change like this, similar to what we did with the rest of `jax/numpy/__init__.pyi`\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-10-03T19:27:48Z: Another option would be to avoid the `Protocol` and annotate them more directly as `_ScalarMeta`, I'm not sure which I'd prefer. `JAXScalarType` may be nicer because it's more human readable.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2023-10-04T18:56:15Z: I think I like the protocol over exposing the implementation details\r\n\r\nI might not call it `JAXScalarType` because the `JAX` is somewhat redundant.\r\n\r\nOverall I'm in favor of  doing something like this.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-10-04T23:09:36Z: > I might not call it `JAXScalarType` because the `JAX` is somewhat redundant.\r\n\r\nRenamed to `ScalarType`\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-10-12T20:55:42Z: Some updates here: there is a *ton* of downstream code that uses annotations like `-> jnp.float32` ([codesearch](https://github.com/search?q=%22-%3E+jnp.float%22+lang%3Apython&type=code)), which will never be valid: it's impossible to create instances of the type `float32` because JAX doesn't have scalar types.\r\n\r\nStill, the intent of those annotations is clear: users want an annotation that communicates both to the reader of the code and to the static type checker that the input is an array (or perhaps array-like) with a float32 dtype.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering now whether we'll need to provide some dtype-specific array annotations before we can land something like this change.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2023-10-13T14:15:00Z: I agree. We can certainly land this change as is (it makes the world better), but we certainly should see if we can better capture the dtype before forcing everyone to migrate to `jax.Array` as a type annotation.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-06T20:43:16Z: I'm going to close this for now \u2013 there are far too many uses of `jnp.float32` and others as type annotations (currently valid as they are aliases of `Any`) and I'm not sure how to proceed without a decent typed array replacement.\n",

I think this lies in a bit of a gray area because the corresponding distribution isn't implemented in `scipy.stats`. We don't have any hard policy regarding what is in scope for `jax.scipy.stats`, but generally adding functionality beyond what is in scipy requires some discussion.\r\n\r\nWho do you anticipate is the audience for this functionality? Can we think of a better home for it rather than including it in jax itself?\n- harryjulian commented on 2022-12-14T17:54:58Z: Figures.

However, the paper suggests it is a more numerically stable alternative to the von-Mises Fisher distribution - so I guess it would also be appropriate for such use cases.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any other specific Jax-based libraries which would be a better fit, off the top of my head.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-03T22:27:50Z: I think I'm going to close this \u2013 it's not clear that these routines are in scope for `jax.scipy`.

Otherwise, I can continue working on it whenever I retain my bandwidth.\r\n\r\nA few notes about my PR (you can further discuss with @jakevdp to see if those points are valid to address):\r\n1. the numerical discrepancy between my JAX implementation v.s. scipy's is NOT immaterial, despite ramping up the resampling number. Can't give you a precise statistics (discrepancy of ~0.01?) because I coded it a few months ago, but such discrepancy could probably make unit test to fail\r\n2. my JAX implementation is a bit slower than scipy's in some settings (CPU).\r\n3. Scipy bootstrap supports a lot of different scenarios (e.g. multi-statistics, one-set/ multi-set/ paired samples, different bootstrap methods). For now I am not confident if my implementation works as expected under various scenarios.\r\n\r\nLook forward to your contribution to the ticket.\n- carlosgmartin commented on 2023-02-02T02:03:52Z: @wonhyeongseo Are you still interested in tackling this?\n- wonhyeongseo commented on 2023-02-03T09:12:04Z: Hello @carlosgmartin !

I don't doubt this is correct, but it's definitely not obvious from reading the code.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure we're covering all corners, can you run locally a more complete set of tests on this?\r\n```\r\n$ JAX_NUM_GENERATED_CASES=500 pytest -n auto tests/lax_numpy_test.py -k testTile\r\n```\r\nThanks!\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-11T18:50:04Z: Sure, I'd like to run a more complete set of tests tomorrow. (It is 2a.m. in my timezone\ud83d\ude34)\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-12T02:45:35Z: I explicitly fixed the scalar case: (to prevent mistake in future)\r\n```python\r\nmerged_rs = [(r * s,) if r == 1 or s == 1 else (r, s) for r, s in zip(reps, A_shape)]\r\ntarget_shape = tuple(e for t in merged_rs for e in t) # chain\r\ndims = tuple(np.cumsum([len(t) for t in merged_rs]) - 1)[-ndim(A):] if ndim(A) else ()\r\nresult = lax.broadcast_in_dim(A, target_shape, dims)\r\n```\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-04-12T03:22:51Z: @jakevdp I don't know what does the error message mean, could you please take a look and give some advice?\r\n```\r\nJAX_NUM_GENERATED_CASES=500 pytest -n auto tests/lax_numpy_test.py -k

Every change has non-zero risk. \r\nHowever, for #10221 reverted by #10437 , one of the reason why `tile` generate a much complex jaxpr is the absence of optimization for `tile` in this PR, which can reduce 2 `reshape` to one and remove squeeze. (Though one `reshape` may still break TPU compiler).\r\nActually, in terms of jaxpr or HLO, the proposed implementation in this PR is **strictly simpler** than the original implementation.\r\n\n- YouJiacheng commented on 2022-07-07T14:47:09Z: After 2 months(such that I can read the code as if it isn't written by myself\ud83d\ude02), I can judge that the readability decrease significantly.

So I guess, I won't be able to get that protocol using `ParamSpec` until MyPy has fixes.  Could we use a protocol that doesn't use `ParamSpec`?\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", covariant=True)\r\n\r\n# TODO: Use ParamSpec to annotate function parameters.\r\nclass JittedFunction(Protocol, Generic[T]):\r\n  def __call__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> T:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n  def lower(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Lowered:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then where you have `Callable`, you could have `Callable[..., T]` and you could return `JittedFunction[T]`.

We chatted a bit about this offline, and I think we'd prefer for this utility to not be part of JAX's public API, as it really has more to do with numpy dtypes than anything special to JAX. If you want a quick way to get this result, you can do something like this:\r\n```python\r\ndef dtype_real(dtype):\r\n  return np.finfo(dtype).dtype if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.complexfloating) else dtype\r\n```\n- PhilipVinc commented on 2021-05-05T18:13:14Z: I see.\r\nIndeed it might be something that should be in numpy.  \r\nBut it isn't.\r\nMost people probably don't use complex numbers, but since jax's support of complex numbers in AD is somewhat... contrived, this is a fundamental function to have. \r\n\r\nLooking at jax.dtpes I see the following symbols:\r\n```python\r\n>>> jax.dtypes.\r\njax.dtypes.bfloat16(            jax.dtypes.finfo(               jax.dtypes.iinfo(               jax.dtypes.result_type(\r\njax.dtypes.canonicalize_dtype(  jax.dtypes.float0               jax.dtypes.issubdtype(          jax.dtypes.scalar_type_of(\r\n```\r\n\r\n`result_type` In particular! if I need to compute the result type of an operation that is R->R or C->R, I have the need for `dtype_real`, otherwise how can I compute the result?\r\n\r\nThis, for me, is telling that it is essential when computing dtypes.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-05-05T18:19:53Z: I'm not certain I understand the comparison you're making to `result_type`, which is basically JAX's version of `np.result_type` specialized to JAX's promotion logic.\r\n\r\nThe `dtype_real` utility is only used in one place in JAX; unless there are good arguments for keeping it, I'd probably be in favor of removing it altogether.\n- PhilipVinc commented on 2021-05-07T10:53:46Z: My argument is that `np.result_type` allows you to compute the type promotion logic of some operation involving two types. \r\nSo if I write a custom jax primitive doing something like a sum `+(a,b) = a+b`, I can implement the abstract evaluation logic using `np.result_type(a, b)`.\r\nBut If I write a custom jax primitive doing something like a norm `custom(a) = a.conj()*a` the abstract evaluation logic needs `dtype_real`. You can write your own, `dtype_real` with a series of `if,else`, but that is ugly.\r\n\r\nuse cases I have for it are (what we are using it in NetKet): \r\n  - computing the resulting `dtype` of statistical objects (variance, autocorrelation time...) which are all real-valued even if the input data is complex-valued. \r\n  - In some layers with precise mathematical properties, we want some parameters to be real no matter what, while the rest can be complex too. We ask the user to specify the dtype of the layer, which can be any floating-point type, but then need to extract the `real_dtype`.\r\n\r\nIn essence, yes, `dtype_real` is fairly niche in that not a lot of people care about complex numbers.\r\n\r\nFor people who care about complex numbers, this is an important tool and avoids littering the code with \r\n`dtype_real= lambda typ:jnp.ones((), typ)).real` or smarter implementations. \r\n\r\nAgain, I do think that this should be a numpy thing really, but as it's not, I think it's a fairly useful thing to be included in jax.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-05-07T12:30:28Z: Thanks for outlining your thinking. It still seems to me that a utility that's not specific to JAX, is used only once in all the JAX codebase, and that can be reproduced in a single line is not a great candidate to be part of the public API.\n",

Yes, I think you are right. I would need to look into it a bit more closely, but I think numpy uses something like the following logic:\r\n```python\r\nresult_dtype = dtype or np.result_type(a, b)\r\nif not (np.can_cast(a.dtype, result_dtype) and np.can_cast(b.dtype, result_dtype))\r\n    raise\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Back to your previous comment, we may want to step back and decide whether it is a goal to handle optional ufunc keywords consistently across jax; I'm not certain what the answer is.\r\n\r\nI agree, this is something that should be handled for all ufuncs consistently. I think a first step would be to decide whether it is within the scope of JAX to support the `casting` argument in all ufuncs. Once JAX follows the same ufunc casting rules as numpy, supporting user definable result dtypes should be pretty easy. But then again the question whether the added maintenance burden for supporting all ufunc arguments is a worthwhile investment is still not obvious.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-03T22:07:15Z: Sorry to have let this go stale. In the meantime, `jax.numpy.matmul` has added a `preferred_element_type` argument, which gets passed directly to `lax.dot_general`.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this for now; feel free to re-open if you'd like to work on adding the `dtype` argument here.

It might make https://github.com/google/jax/issues/3893 fast out-of-the-box, removing the need to keep optimized NumPy implementations of shape rules.\n- shoyer commented on 2020-08-21T21:25:16Z: @JuliusKunze I would be a little reluctant to support directly overriding `jax.numpy` functions. JAX works so well in part because transformations are written at the LAX primitive level, which is a much more uniform and rationalized interface than `jax.numpy`. That's the main reason why I suggested this interface as a temporary measure -- it would be much better (if possible) to figure out a uniform interface for threading variables holding mutable state through transformations.\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2021-02-05T11:18:10Z: Whoa, this is awesome!!  This would resolve my problem in Haiku (linked above) and it seems very versatile too.  What's the future of this pull request?\n- jekbradbury commented on 2021-02-07T07:12:46Z: I think I support this. We haven't made any progress on a unified state mechanism since the last time this was proposed, and it's better than external libraries directly monkeypatching JAX. Note that most libraries that provide state-aware versions of functions like `jit`, `scan`, etc. add additional knobs/functionality to those functions (and not necessarily in a mutually compatible way), so this feature doesn't solve all aspects of the problem.\n- shoyer commented on 2021-02-07T19:31:25Z: Since drafting this, we actually have use-case for this in our own application code where `haiku.scan` wasn't quite right and we wanted our own version.\r\n\r\nMy one thought is that we should probably make it clearer that it's experimental. If we don't think it's worth making a new experimental module, perhaps we should just include \"experimental\" in the name, e.g., `jax.experimental_override_context`? Or perhaps it can just live in the top-level `jax.experimental` namespace along with the `enable_x64`/`disable_x64` context managers.\n- shoyer commented on 2021-02-07T22:43:03Z: This is ready for review now.\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2021-02-08T01:53:58Z: Wow, I appreciate how fast the Jax team responds to issues!\r\n\r\nI'm just curious, would it be worth adding the `eval_shape` override to the list?  Haiku seems to provide an override.\n- froystig commented on 2021-02-08T03:50:35Z: Placing `override_context` in `experimental` sounds good to me.\n- shoyer commented on 2021-02-08T05:50:00Z: > I'm just curious, would it be worth adding the `eval_shape` override to the list? Haiku seems to provide an override.\r\n\r\nYes, absolutely!\r\n\r\nI think I got them all, but let me know if you notice any others that are missing. (It's also easy to extend this in the future, of course.)\n- shoyer commented on 2021-02-10T00:38:03Z: Tests are passing -- is anyone from the JAX team up for a review?\n- shoyer commented on 2021-02-26T17:39:25Z: After discussion with the whole JAX team, we decided _not_ to go further with this PR at this time. It solves some real problems (writing library code that uses higher order functions that wants to be compatible with stateful transformations), but:\r\n\r\n1. Clearly isn't the ultimate solution (which would be some universal system for managing state _inside_ JAX)\r\n2. It is still something that is going to require application specific choices. For example, if you `scan` over a neural net layer, should the weights be scanned over or not?\r\n\r\nFor now, the recommendation is to write your own, library specific implementations of higher order functions like `scan` and your own scope for overrides, if necessary.\n",

Am I correct saying that for the specific case of `sqrt` we want to remove the mention or `lib.scimath.sqrt` (as pointed out in #2979) and the `where` parameter (which is missing from the new documentation)?\r\n\r\nI think that we should avoid making a copy of the numpy documentation. Perhaps we can just add a note about differences, and then include the original documentation? \r\n\r\nIf instead we do want JAX-specific documentation, I think that it is best to put it next to the \r\ndefinition of `jax.numpy.sqrt` instead of a separate file. My thinking is that there is no point in inventing a new mechanism for associating documentation with definitions. \r\n\r\n@skye PTAL\r\n\n- joaogui1 commented on 2020-05-11T11:18:07Z: @gnecula  I don't understand the comment about `where`, it's not in the documentation and I think JAX doesn't support it, right?\r\nThe idea of the separate file was so we wouldn't change too much the library because of a small problem (in this case a somewhat confusing comment in the docstring of a single function) and we could keep that up until/if the number of custom docstrings grows considerably\n- gnecula commented on 2020-05-11T11:55:54Z: Re: `where`, I just wanted to make sure that I understand the scope of the changes, since it was not mentioned in #2979 as a problem. JAX does not support it and it is fine that is missing from the documentation. \r\n\r\nI am assuming that needing a custom documentation is the exception, not the common case. In those cases, I think it is preferable to add a docstring where the function is defined, rather than \r\nputting it in a separate file, for the same reason that `numpy` has the documentation in docstrings rather than in a separate file. \r\n\r\nMy preference would be to just have a short paragraph that explains how JAX's version is different than numpy (assuming the differences are small and easily explainable), and then include verbatim the numpy documentation. This way we do not have to maintain a \r\nseparate documentation string than numpy. \r\n\r\nWe can see what Skye thinks also. @skye \r\n \n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-05-11T13:39:53Z: Another comment is that we must respect copyright here. I haven't looked into the details, but at a minimum anything copied from NumPy (e.g., doc strings) must go in the `third_party/numpy` directory.\n- skye commented on 2020-05-11T16:18:41Z: I like this proposal. Peter correctly points out we should put the docstrings in `jax/third_party/numpy`, which sounds like reason enough for putting the docstrings in a separate file, so I won't go into why I thought it was a good idea even without the copyright consideration.\r\n\r\nWe could just add a note to the top of the documentation. As I see it, the upshot is that we don't need this extra complexity. The downside is lower-quality documentation (e.g. \"blah blah blah ... please disregard the confusing bit below ... confusing bit ...\", and in this case the confusing bit is highlighted in an eye-catching box). There's probably some argument about updates to the original numpy documentation, but I think that could go either way depending on if the updates still align with what our version of the function does :) Am I missing anything?\r\n\r\nI think it's worth having the higher-quality documentation, and it clears the way for future improvements of this kind. However, I'd also be ok adding the note for now and seeing if it comes up for other numpy functions.\n- gnecula commented on 2020-05-11T17:16:27Z: I'd be interested to know how many cases we know of where we need to have custom documentation, and what are the cases when it is really awkward to rely on a comment at the top to list unimplemented or different behavior. \n- hoffmannjordan commented on 2020-05-11T20:41:26Z: I noticed that `vander` also [references](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/jax.numpy.vander.html\r\n) something that isn't (yet) in JAX.\r\n`nanmax` [references](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/jax.numpy.nanmax.html) `fmin()` which isn't implemented.\r\nI haven't gone through looking, though, so I'm guessing there are more.\r\n\n- jakevdp commented on 2020-05-11T23:32:18Z: I'm -1 on specializing docstrings further: it seems like it would open us to playing an eternal, unwinnable game of whack-a-mole (in particular, even when we're \"done\" with a particular numpy release, in the sense of there being no more non-jax functions mentioned, the next numpy release might modify docstrings further)\r\n\r\nCurrently the numpy docs are prefaced by \"Original documentation below\", which (to me) implies that I'm reading the numpy docstring. Perhaps we could make the language in that indicator more clear? Something like\r\n```\r\n\"This function provides a jax implementation of the np.sqrt function. Numpy docstring below:\"\r\n```\r\nThat would be far more maintainable in the long-run.\n- jakevdp commented on 2020-05-11T23:34:24Z: This situation will also be improved by our adopting the convention of importing jax.numpy as ``jnp`` rather than ``np``; that will make it more clear that the numpy portions docstrings are referrring to numpy, rather than jax.\n- joaogui1 commented on 2020-05-14T08:42:17Z: I don't think so. \r\nWe are implementing `jax.numpy`, which already makes one think they will be dealing with an API compatible with Numpy, then if we use the same docstring users will be really confused when the JAX functions don't work the same way Numpy functions do\n- gnecula commented on 2020-05-14T08:52:24Z: Let's try to make progress on this. I see that several of us have expressed reservations about making an almost-copy of the numpy documentation. I think that the maintainability cost is still an issue even if we put it in third_party/numpy. How about the following compromise:\r\n\r\n* We have the option to add a custom docstring to lax.numpy primitives, along with the definition of the primitive.\r\n* The _wrap function will do what it does already, except that it can insert this custom docstring before it includes the original numpy implementation\r\n* We put in that custom docstring only what is specific about lax implementation. This may include notes about how it differs from the original numpy. \n- skye commented on 2020-05-19T18:24:01Z: I think what I wrote in [my above comment](https://github.com/google/jax/pull/3023#issuecomment-626804362) is still true. Re: Jake's point about numpy versions, I would guess having an accurate version of older numpy docs would usually be better than the updated numpy version (especially since I'm guessing most updates to numpy documentation are to introduce new features that jax doesn't support).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like everyone else prefers a note at the top though, so let's do that, and we can revisit if people are still confused. It looks like `_wraps` already supports this ([link](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/master/jax/numpy/_util.py#L85)), so it's just a matter of adding the note.\n",

In that case I guess users will need to use more explicit `jax.device_put` calls (if they don\u2019t import `jax.numpy` as before.\r\n\r\nYes, that would work. More practically, the easy way to ensure functions get executed with JAX is to use `jit`.\r\n\r\n> More importantly, this would change the behavior for anyone using `import numpy as onp`: where that could previously be used to convert to host-side ndarrays, now it might not, meaning users would need more explicit `jax.device_get` calls.\r\n\r\nThat's right, this would be a breaking change for such code. Instead, users will need to write `onp.array()` explicitly to convert into NumPy arrays. It might be worth testing this change on our internal codebase to gauge its impact.\r\n\r\nFor the most part I expect this will should be fine -- JAX has mostly equivalent implementations of most commonly used NumPy functions.\r\n\r\nOne noteworthy case are functions like `np.unique()` that exist in NumPy but not JAX.

IIRC namedtuple instances are subclasses of `tuple` but have slightly different creation signatures, i.e. `TupleSubclass((1, 2, 3))` vs `NamedtupleSubclass(1, 2, 3)`, which might need handling.\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-03-15T00:26:52Z: It's pretty unfortunate that Python namedtuples don't have an abstract base class--in our context, it makes them indistinguishable from core JAX types implemented as tuple subclasses (like `PartialVal` and `JaxTuple`) which need to be treated as leaves for the purposes of `pytree`. Rather than special-casing named tuples, I went ahead and implemented the ability to register a type as a leaf, and registering those two tuple subclasses was enough to get tests to pass.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I should also add leaf registration for `AbstractTuple`, `Destructuring`, and `JaxprTracerTuple` (or any others)--I haven't looked into whether any of those can appear in the trees passed to the tree_utils machinery (leaving them out hasn't broken any tests).\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-03-15T00:28:54Z: (Also, adding a test was a great idea, because it turns out the code in the original PR didn't actually do anything).\n- levskaya commented on 2019-03-15T08:45:34Z: I like the idea!  I agree that the way namedtuples are implemented in python is pretty annoying.  As an aside, you _can_ make namedtuple equivalents that have a (non-tuple) base class, this is one that should work equivalently in py2/py3 for all the ways we use them in JAX:\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import Sequence\r\n\r\nclass SaneNamedTuple(Sequence): \r\n    \"\"\"Subclass and define named fields with __slots__.\"\"\"\r\n    __slots__ = ()\r\n    def __init__(self, *args):\r\n        for slot, arg in zip(self.__slots__, args):\r\n            setattr(self, slot, arg)\r\n    def __repr__(self):\r\n        attr_repr = ', '.join(map(lambda x: \"%s=%r\"%(x[0], x[1]),\r\n                         tuple(zip(self.__slots__, tuple(self)))))\r\n        return '{name}({args})'.format(name=type(self).__name__, args=attr_repr)\r\n    def __iter__(self): \r\n        for name in self.__slots__:\r\n            yield getattr(self, name)\r\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\r\n        return getattr(self, self.__slots__[index])\r\n    def __len__(self):\r\n        return len(self.__slots__)\r\n\r\ndef sane_namedtuple(cls_name, attr_names):\r\n  \"Create a named tuple-like class with name cls_name and fields attr_names.\"\r\n  assert isinstance(attr_names, (list, tuple))\r\n  return type(cls_name,\r\n              (SaneNamedTuple,), \r\n              {\"__slots__\": tuple(attr_names)})\r\n\r\nPoint = sane_namedtuple(\"Point\", (\"x\", \"y\"))\r\npt = Point(1, 2)\r\nprint(pt)  # Point(x=1, y=2)\r\nprint(pt.x, pt.y)  # 1 2\r\nprint(isinstance(pt, Point))  # True\r\nprint(isinstance(pt, SaneNamedTuple))  # True\r\nprint(isinstance(pt, Sequence))  # True\r\nprint(isinstance(pt, tuple))  # False\r\nx, y = pt\r\nprint(x, y)  # 1 2\r\n```\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-03-15T19:02:43Z: Added a docstring.

Here that means that `SaneNamedTuple`s expose `*args` as their constructor signature rather than the set of fields in the named tuple.\n- levskaya commented on 2019-03-16T03:09:42Z: @jekbradbury - I see what you want.  In python2 this is pretty much true. :(  In python3 we have the tools of inspect.Signature and inspect.Parameter which can set `__signature__` to do this though:\r\n```python\r\n     from inspect import Signature, Parameter\r\n    # ... in base class def:\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_signature(cls):\r\n        parameters = [\r\n          Parameter(name=slot, kind=Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD) for slot in cls.__slots__\r\n        ]\r\n        return Signature(parameters=parameters)\r\n\r\n    def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):\r\n        # ....\r\n        cls.__slots__ = tuple(slots)\r\n        cls.__signature__ = cls.get_signature()\r\n```\r\nyet another reason to drop py2 given it hasn't been improved in 10 years...\n- levskaya commented on 2019-03-18T06:31:15Z: Sorry to keep distracting from the main point of this thread :)  to be concrete vis a vis above, this is the implementation of base-classable nametuple that I've seen before for py3.\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import Sequence\r\nfrom inspect import Signature, Parameter\r\nclass SaneNamedTuple(Sequence): \r\n    __slots__ = ()\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_signature(cls):\r\n        parameters = [Parameter(name=slot, kind=Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD) \r\n                      for slot in cls.__slots__]\r\n        return Signature(parameters=parameters)\r\n    def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)\r\n        slots = cls.__slots__\r\n        cls.__slots__ = (tuple(slots.split()) if isinstance(slots, str) else tuple(slots))\r\n        cls.__signature__ = cls.get_signature()\r\n        cls.__init__.__signature__ = cls.get_signature()\r\n        cls.__doc__ = ('{cls.__name__}{cls.__signature__}\\n\\n{cls.__doc__}'.format(cls=cls))\r\n    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        if cls is SaneNamedTuple:\r\n            raise TypeError(\"Can't instantiate abstract class SaneNamedTuple\")\r\n        return super().__new__(cls)\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def _get_bound_args(cls, args, kwargs):\r\n        return Signature.bind(cls.__signature__, *args, **kwargs).arguments.items()\r\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        bound_args = self._get_bound_args(args, kwargs)\r\n        for slot, value in bound_args:\r\n            setattr(self, slot, value)\r\n    def __repr__(self):\r\n        return type(self).__name__ + repr(tuple(self))\r\n    def __iter__(self): \r\n        for name in self.__slots__:\r\n            yield getattr(self, name)\r\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\r\n        return getattr(self, self.__slots__[index])\r\n    def __len__(self):\r\n        return len(self.__slots__)\r\n\r\ndef sane_namedtuple(cls_name, attr_names):\r\n  \"Create a named tuple-like class with name cls_name and fields attr_names.\"\r\n  assert isinstance(attr_names, (list, tuple))\r\n  return type(cls_name,\r\n              (SaneNamedTuple,), \r\n              {\"__slots__\": tuple(attr_names)})\r\n```\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2020-04-20T07:51:36Z: I've also been really interested in dealing with inheritance and pytrees.  I've been inheriting pytree-conversion like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NeilGirdhar/efax/blob/master/efax/tensors/tensor_like.py\r\n\r\nYou can see how it's used here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NeilGirdhar/efax/blob/630b73dadab01271f794119a6d41f5b6fce1bb66/efax/tensors/jax_generator.py#L34\r\n\r\nI have been using it with inheritance too.  When there is no extra information, the subclass inherits the pytree conversion.  When there are extra members, you can override the members, and have the overrides call super:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def from_tensor(cls, values, aux_data):\r\n        super_aux_data, distribution = aux_data\r\n        r = super().from_tensor(values, super_aux_data)\r\n        r.distribution = distribution\r\n        return r\r\n\r\n    def to_tensor(self):\r\n        values, aux_data = super().to_tensor()\r\n        return values, (aux_data, self.distribution)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of this inheritance approach is that it supports `isinstance` checks, and you can use `TensorLike` in type annotations.  For example, I have the following type annotations:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nShape = Tuple[int, ...]\r\nShapeLike = Union[int, Sequence[int]]\r\nSliceLike = Tuple[Union[int, None, slice], ...]\r\nTensor = Union[np.ndarray, jnp.ndarray]\r\nPyTree = Union[Tensor, 'TensorLike', Container['PyTree']]\r\n```\n- jekbradbury commented on 2020-04-21T03:01:49Z: I like this a lot! I was unaware of `__init_subclass__`; that's a pretty cool feature.\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2020-05-01T13:29:43Z: I thought I would throw up an issue since it would be nice to have https://github.com/google/jax/issues/2916\n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-06-24T15:12:57Z: Do we still want to merge this or something along these lines, or should we close this PR?\n"

(it's not returning garbage, it's actually attempting a valid computation).\r\n\r\nMy thinking here: in general JAX functionality is a superset of numpy functionality. So just because NumPy returns a TypeError doesn't mean JAX must as well. Does that make sense?\n- rajasekharporeddy commented on 2024-10-10T05:08:28Z: Thanks for the clarification @jakevdp. Can I modify this PR to add the docstring for `arctan2`?\n- pearu commented on 2024-10-11T10:20:42Z: atan2 is implemented in stablehlo, see https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo/blob/main/docs/spec.md#atan2 . Usually, arctan2 for complex inputs is not supported (for example, by numpy, torch, Python array API standard v2023.12, C++ numerics library, etc) as `atan2(y, x)` is associated with the direction angle of the point `(x, y)` in the  Cartesian coordinates. However, numerically, supporting `atan2` for complex inputs does make sense for cases where `x` is complex zero or close to complex zero, and ideally, `atan2(y, x)` should be more accurate than `atan(y / x)`.\r\n\r\nThat said, the current implementation of atan2 on complex inputs in stablehlo is problematic accuracy-wise. For example:\r\n```python\r\n>> x, y = 1+0.00001j, 1-0.00001j\r\n>>> jnp.arctan2(y, x)   # the imaginary part is inaccurate\r\nArray(0.7853981-1.001353e-05j, dtype=complex64, weak_type=True)\r\n>>> jnp.arctan(y / x)   # expected\r\nArray(0.7853982-1.e-05j, dtype=complex64, weak_type=True)\r\n```\r\nand atm I would recommend using `atan(y / x)` instead of `atan2(y, x)` when `x != 0+0j` (I'll add this issue to my todo list).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to allow the switch `numpy <-> jax.numpy` in both directions, the current PR makes sense, although, I second @jakevdp point that jax.numpy will likely never be equivalent to `numpy`.\n- jakevdp commented on 2024-10-16T16:13:26Z: I think we should close this PR, because we shouldn't deprecate or raise an error for complex inputs to this function.\n- rajasekharporeddy commented on 2024-10-17T02:15:36Z: Thanks!

Currently `DimSize` is a more complicated way to spell `Any`. In general, tightening the definition of pubic type aliases is a *very* painful change, because there's no way to do a soft deprecation period for static types. Given that, we should avoid exporting a type name until we're happy with it's definition.\n",

I can not do that with just the original definition of `f` unless I do that transform instead on every single worker, which is not scalable for my goals. \n- chaserileyroberts commented on 2023-10-24T16:55:53Z: > which is not scalable for my goals.\r\n\r\nFor example: if my transform is a randomized optimization, I would need to ensure all of the workers came to the exact same solution. Possible, but incredibly fragile. Solving this first on the client before dispatching prevents this issue forever. \n- chaserileyroberts commented on 2023-10-24T17:47:40Z: I want jaxprs to be able to be passed around, modified, and executed using standard distributed python tooling. This could have a wide range of applications beyond just pickling `jit(f)`\r\n\r\nYou could imagine the jaxprs being used with a Ray / Dask server just for the _compiler optimization_ and not even the actual execution. Something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Use the remote cluster to optimize your jaxpr.\r\njxpr = best_of([optimize.remote(f, seed) for seed in initial_seeds], my_metrics)\r\n\r\n# Execute the jaxpr locally on your GPU.\r\njax.jit(jaxpr_as_fun(jxpr))(my_args)\r\n```\n- froystig commented on 2023-10-24T22:45:30Z: I think we can imagine similar such things (in fact, @mattjj had a branch doing something similar for a Ray prototype a while back, though we never merged it). While we all broadly agree that this can be potentially useful, it's not free, hence the questions about alternatives. For your immediate, concrete use case, does pickling `jit(f)` suffice? Could you do anything else short of pickling jaxpr?\n- chaserileyroberts commented on 2023-10-25T00:03:21Z: >  For your immediate, concrete use case, does pickling jit(f) suffice?\r\n\r\nSadly not really, I've tried and it's usually pretty painful.\r\n\r\n> Could you do anything else short of pickling jaxpr?\r\n\r\nThis is the setup I want to solve: I have a jax function, `f`, and I have a transform `trfm`, which can be expensive, and possibly non deterministic. I want to execute `trfm(f)(args...)` in an SPMD fashion on a distributed `mesh`\r\n\r\nI've come up with several ideas to do this\r\n\r\n1. Make all of the transforms execute on the workers. \r\n     * This is what is recommended currently in JAX.\r\n     * This is reasonable for well-defined, deterministic transforms (i.e., `grad, vmap, vjp`), but can become difficult if `trfm` needs to do expensive optimization searches, or if any randomization is used. \r\n     * When developers create their own custom transform as `jax.extend` evolves, they're going to have a bad time ~if~ when they need to debug a nondeterminism bug across a cluster. \r\n\r\n2. Make some kind of separate IR that is pickled instead of the `Jaxpr`s. \r\n    * I don't think anyone wants to support this lol. \r\n\r\n3. Support pickling `Jaxprs`. \r\n     * This PR. \r\n     * In this setup, our `Jaxpr` can be derived locally if `trfm` is randomized or complicated. We then dispatch this jaxpr with Ray or Dask (via cloudpickle) to the entire mesh. \r\n     * All nodes have the exact same `Jaxpr`, so when you run `jit(jaxpr_as_fun(jaxpr))(arg...)` on all nodes simultaneously, the chance of bugs related to nodes running mismatching SPMD binaries drops significantly. \r\n\r\nHonestly, these are the only solutions I could think of. I've had to both 1) and 2) at various times in the past and they always are very fragile. If instead I could have 3) JustWork\u2122, it would significantly simplify a lot of the dispatching infrastructure for auto-partitioning work. \r\n\r\nThere could be a forth even easier solution I am missing, but I haven't found it yet. Ideas are welcomed! \r\n\r\n>  While we all broadly agree that this can be potentially useful, it's not free, hence the questions about alternatives\r\n\r\nNothing is ever free, but what is the cost we're trying to avoid here? We have unit tests that will catch obvious problems quickly, and I am happy to be the one responsible to fix issues related to this (I'll probably be the one hitting issues the most anyway lol). \r\n\r\nI can see the argument against adding another global dictionary to manage, but we already use similar global dictionaries for `vmap`, `jit`, `grad`, and well, basically everything! It's not a weird thing to see in the JAX codebase. \r\n\r\nI can also see an argument against the name strings being used for infrastructure. I also don't like this either, but the inclusion of `namespace` and possibly also including the `jax.__version__` (I should add this...), should be enough to avoid conflicts/compatibility issues.  There are no name conflicts as it stands today (at least in OSS land), and again issues could likely be caught quickly with good unit tests.\r\n\r\nSo the cost is: \r\n* Manage 40 new LOC, a single extra global dictionary, and a few unit tests. \r\n* Risk that we add new attributes that are not pickleable in the future and have to deal with them. \r\n  * Unit tests will likely catch it, and you can `None` them out in a `__reduce_ex__` method like I did with `Traceback`. Annoying but not terrible. \r\n\r\nThe value: \r\n* Ray and Dask are automatically fully compatible with Jaxprs. \r\n* Unlocks distributed jaxpr optimizations and dispatch.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it's super worth it. \n- froystig commented on 2023-10-26T14:54:41Z: At one point not long ago, @pschuh made executables experimentally serializable by relying on pickle's persistent ID mechanism.

The key dtype could then look more like other dtypes.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-09-26T18:58:51Z: Are you proposing something like this for the new API?\r\n```python\r\ndef wrap_key_data(key_bits_array: Array, *, impl: Optional[str] = None, dtype: Optional[ExtendedDtype] = None):\r\n  if dtype is not None:\r\n    assert impl is None, \"only one of impl and dtype may be specified\"\r\n    impl_obj = dtype.impl  # eventually a private attribute\r\n  else:\r\n    impl_obj = resolve_prng_impl(impl)\r\n  return prng.random_wrap(key_bits_array, impl=impl_obj)\r\n```\n- froystig commented on 2023-09-26T21:57:46Z: Not quite. What I'm suggesting we consider is keeping `wrap_key_data` as is, and then introducing a new function `key_impl`. The `key_impl` function takes a dtype (maybe also an array, for convenience) and returns a string specifying the implementation. The string, when passed back to `wrap_key_data`, closes the round trip:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nk = jax.random.key(...)\r\ndata = jax.random.key_data(k)\r\nimpl = jax.random.key_impl(k)    # or k.dtype\r\nk2 = jax.random.wrap_key_data(data, impl=impl)\r\nassert k.dtype == k2.dtype\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeparately, I'm suggesting we hide `.impl` from the `k.dtype` object's public attributes. What do you think of that?\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-09-26T22:49:27Z: > ... returns a string specifying the implementation. The string, when passed back to wrap_key_data, closes the round trip:\r\n\r\nOK, in that case it sounds like we'll need `PRNGKeyImpl` to have some kind of registry system, whereby when it is created it will register its name with some dictionary that maps strings to impls that can then be used by `resolve_prng_impl`.\r\n\r\nWe'll have to figure out what to do if someone tries to register a duplicate impl name: probably the best thing would be to error in that case, because it could cause unintended consequences. An annoying part about that though is if you're developing iteratively in a notebook, then re-executing a cell that defines your `PRNGKeyImpl` would lead to a duplicate registration error.\r\n\r\nAnother option is that rather than returning a unique string identifier, we instead return the actual `PRNGImpl` object. What do you think?\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-09-27T16:32:11Z: Another observation here: `jax.random.default_prng_impl()` returns a `PRNGImpl` object, not a string. I've found a case where a user is doing something like:\r\n```python\r\nkey = jax.random.key(seed, impl=jax.random.default_prng_impl())\r\n```\r\nwhich seems like it should work, but it doesn't for the reasons discussed above.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to go with the \"impls are only referred to by their string name\" route, we'll have to figure out what to do with `jax.random.default_prng_impl()`.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-10-06T15:46:44Z: Replaced by #17983\n",

So far I debugged this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef f_jax(x, flag=True):\r\n  return jnp.sin(x) if flag else jnp.cos(x)\r\n\r\ntf.function(jax2tf.convert(f_jax))(0.7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above code `tf.function` will try to be smart and see the default value of `flag=True` and invoke `jax2tf.convert` not with just one positional argument but also with `flag=True`, which will make the JAX machinery use a tracer for the value of `flag`, which will fail with a concretization error in `if flag`. The workaround is to explicitly hide the default parameter to `f_jax`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntf.function(jax2tf.convert(lambda x: f_jax(x)))(0.7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also comes up with things like `jax2tf.convert(jnp.sum)` because `jnp.sum` takes several default arguments that cannot be tracers.\r\n\r\n(This is starting to make me wonder if this change is worth having. It is pretty hard to debug the issue above, and the error looks like a jax2tf one, with an exception thrown from JAX, even though the issue is with `tf.function` having too much magic.)\r\n\n- maxwillzq commented on 2023-09-20T17:13:42Z: Can `autograph=False` of `tf.function` fix this problem on those failed test ? Because `autograph=True` will replace the python 'if' to `tf.if` op.  So it can preserve data dependent control flow.\r\n \n- gnecula commented on 2023-09-21T14:38:16Z: `autograph=False` will not solve the problem, because it would try to trace through all the control flow in `jax2tf` itself.\r\n\r\nPlus there are other instances when such default arguments need to be treated as static, e.g., when they are used to compute shapes.\n",

The rotation functions are now considered [out-of-scope](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jep/18137-numpy-scipy-scope.html#scipy-spatial) for `jax.scipy`, so we likely will not be adding additional functionality to them.\r\n\r\nA separate package looks useful, but a better approach may be to support jax rotation operations via scipy's array API support (see https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/20544). JAX is close to having full support for the Array API (see #21088), and once `scipy.spatial` adds array API support those functions will be able to be used directly on JAX arrays, and lower to JAX operations. At that point, we will likely deprecate and remove `jax.scipy.spatial`.\n- chrisflesher commented on 2024-06-06T19:39:11Z: Ah, sounds great! Thanks for letting me know about the Array API changes, was planning to manually convert more scipy libraries but this will free up some time to work on something else.\n- mdhaber commented on 2024-06-08T14:22:58Z: I think the best existing issue for adding array API support to `scipy.spatial` is scipy/scipy#18867.

Motivations for merging:\r\n - I already have the implementation and as far as I can tell there isn't a JAX solution to the assignment problem available in public libraries,\r\n - there seemed to be sufficient interest in #10403, and I'd say [optimal assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem)/ matching is a fairly common problem across a range of fields.\r\n\r\nAs for where it should live, I'm unsure how much coverage of the SciPy API the JAX team aim to provide. If the goal is to ease adoption via familiar APIs then having it in JAX directly makes sense to me. If the maintenance is deemed to be an issue then I'd be happy to look at other libraries, but hadn't come across any that seemed as suitable. Suggestions more than welcome.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-08-08T21:27:28Z: I think one possible location for this might be the [JAXopt](https://jaxopt.github.io/) package: we've mostly abandoned work on `jax.scipy.optimize` because JAXopt contains much more rigorous and complete implementations of optimizers in JAX, free from the need to match scipy's legacy API.

There are 8000 primitive tests now, and some changes end up breaking multiple tests. It is very useful to see at a glance which primitives are broken, or even if the breakages are due to a particular dtype or any other detail. For example, I use test filtering in internal Google test logs to explore the space of tests and try to understand what is the characteristic shared by all the tests. Having to look at the individual test logs for the details would make this much harder.\r\n\r\nMy workflow so far is to edit the test \"one_containing\" parameter to filter out the test that I want.\r\n\r\nI will look into the particular restrictions for `pytest -k` and think of a way to enable it.

We looked at changing that a while ago (the `promote_integers` argument was something I added as an intended backward-compatibilty shim after we had decided to do this), but midway through the planned change there was a lot of pushback because it introduced the possibility of silent integer overflows in some cases (integer overflows are already a danger for other integer operations virtually everywhere already, but I digress)\r\n\r\nWhether it makes sense that `broadcast_one_to_all` calls `jnp.sum` directly and inherits its dtype behavior is less clear to me.\r\n\r\nI don't think that this PR should be merged as-is, though: it would be confusing if `psum` had different type semantics from `sum`. Perhaps `psum` should gain a `promote_integers` argument? And perhaps `broadcast_one_to_all` should have different dtype semantics than `sum`? I'm not sure.\n- inailuig commented on 2023-06-23T07:43:42Z: \r\n\r\n\r\n> Looking at this more closely, I think this is intended because you are setting the x64 flag to True so things will get promoted.

Why is summation necessary?\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-06-23T08:28:37Z: Note that in the future, adding or summing PRNG keys will result in an error, because semantically PRNG keys do not support addition. (You can set `jax_enable_custom_prng=True` to see how this will manifest).\r\n\r\nThis tells me that either (1) `broadcast_one_to_all` is semantically incompatible with PRNG keys, or (2) `broadcast_one_to_all` does not require addition/summation of data.\n- yashk2810 commented on 2023-06-23T13:53:11Z: Maybe broadcast_one_to_all is not the right solution for whatever you are trying to do.

We need to run a collective to all-reduce across all the hosts so that the broadcasting can happen.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-06-23T14:17:03Z: OK, then I think we can safely say that `broadcast_one_to_all` is not an appropriate operation for PRNG keys.\n- inailuig commented on 2023-06-23T14:19:06Z: > Maybe broadcast_one_to_all is not the right solution for whatever you are trying to do.

There it is no problem if the type is promoted, therefore no further discussion will be needed.\r\n\r\nI still think it is inconsistent if a broadcast function changes the type, but so be it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help so far, I will close this PR.\r\n\n",

This is why I preffered to not comment int. We can still work on it with a high atol instead of a commented test.

But static `slice` is specialized on static start indices, so each call with different start indices incurs a small overhead in XLA at compile time, and when you accumulate this small overhead thousands of times, it is slower than `dynamic_slice`, which does not have such overhead because it is not specialized on the index values.\n- KeAWang commented on 2022-12-08T18:48:14Z: Thanks! That explains the performance issues I've been trying to debug with slice vs dynamic_slice vs numpy slice.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-03T20:27:24Z: I can no longer reproduce these performance issues, despite this still lowering to static slice.\n",

So if we wanted to do DCE as soon as possible, i.e. as soon as a jaxpr is available, we would do it in `pjit` as in this PR, whereas with `jit` we could only do it in the impl rule.\n",

Maybe @mattjj can weigh in with thoughts?\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-08-09T17:26:20Z: For example, here's a slightly modified version of your zero-length scan in which the types of the inputs match those expected by the body function, and it executes without an error:\r\n```python\r\ndef f(carry, y): \r\n  y1, y2 = y \r\n  return carry + y1 * y2, None \r\nys = jnp.empty((0, 2)) # <-- use a size (0, 2) array instead of a size (0,) array\r\njax.lax.scan(f, 0, ys)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n# (DeviceArray(0., dtype=float32), None)\r\n```\r\nWith this in mind, I'm leaning toward thinking the original error is working as intended. What do you think?\n- frederikwilde commented on 2022-08-09T17:47:48Z: Ah, I see. I encountered the problem in the following way (simplified for brevity):\r\n```Python\r\nys = jnp.arange(10)\r\ncarry, results = 0, []\r\nfor i in range(11):\r\n    carry, _ = scan(f, carry, ys[:i])\r\n    carry = some_other_function(carry)\r\n    carry, _ = scan(f, carry, ys[i:])\r\n    results.append(carry)\r\n```\r\nWith the solution you propose one would need to implement the edge cases `i=0` and `i=10` separately, since empty slices don't contain the full shape of the original array. I don't know whether this is reason enough to allow an - in a strict sense - incorrect type in this special case. Just wanted to mention how this actually appears in a practical case.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-08-09T17:52:02Z: Thanks - I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making in the second example. Empty slices should maintain their shape along non-sliced axes, even for slice size zero; e.g.\r\n```python\r\ny = jnp.empty((10, 2))\r\n\r\nprint(y[:0].shape)\r\n# (0, 2)\r\n\r\nprint(y[10:].shape)\r\n# (0, 2)\r\n```\n- frederikwilde commented on 2022-08-09T17:58:36Z: Oh!

I generate several arrays `ys` over which I loop as described above, but one of them is indeed just an empty array of shape `(1, 0)`.

(You are more than welcome!)\r\n\r\nI think we would be willing in principle to be more involved in `conda-forge` builds, however the key thing that is stopping us being involved with `conda-forge` is the non-commercial nature of Anaconda's repositories. It might be possible to solve that.  *edit*: I didn't realize `miniforge` is a thing.

I failed to make my point clear --- my point was about potential failures with any of the dependencies (e.g. due to pip's lack of enforcements of versions, etc.) and an alternative is to bundle all these pieces into one big chunk. I am not advocating for this alternative, but I am putting out there --- in conda-forge, it is easy to deal with this type of problem because the solver was created for this type of problem. \r\n\r\nSee an example of `ERROR: pip's dependency resolver`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(test37) studio-lab-user@default:~$ python3 -m pip install jaxlib==0.3.15 jax==0.2\r\nCollecting jaxlib==0.3.15\r\n  Downloading jaxlib-0.3.15-cp37-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (72.0 MB)\r\n     \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 72.0/72.0 MB 31.2 MB/s eta 0:00:00\r\nCollecting jax==0.2\r\n  Using cached jax-0.2.0.tar.gz (454 kB)\r\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... done\r\nCollecting numpy>=1.19\r\n  Downloading numpy-1.21.6-cp37-cp37m-manylinux_2_12_x86_64.manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (15.7 MB)\r\n     \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 15.7/15.7 MB 83.5 MB/s eta 0:00:00\r\nCollecting scipy>=1.5\r\n  Downloading scipy-1.7.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux_2_12_x86_64.manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (38.1 MB)\r\n     \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 38.1/38.1 MB 47.8 MB/s eta 0:00:00\r\nCollecting absl-py\r\n  Using cached absl_py-1.2.0-py3-none-any.whl (123 kB)\r\nCollecting opt_einsum\r\n  Using cached opt_einsum-3.3.0-py3-none-any.whl (65 kB)\r\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: jax\r\n  Building wheel for jax (setup.py) ... done\r\n  Created wheel for jax: filename=jax-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl size=522260 sha256=d550af1b87c6ea1bdd35cee9ab5eb6c7a8f007974473f334e6fda3f0c96835a7\r\n  Stored in directory: /home/studio-lab-user/.cache/pip/wheels/13/c7/c3/6f2fcee22080fa37aadd1e7991fccc1adc62722229e10a3663\r\nSuccessfully built jax\r\nInstalling collected packages: numpy, absl-py, scipy, opt_einsum, jaxlib, jax\r\n\r\nSuccessfully installed absl-py-1.2.0 jax-0.2.0 jaxlib-0.3.15 numpy-1.21.6 opt_einsum-3.3.0 scipy-1.7.3\r\n(test37) studio-lab-user@default:~$ \r\n(test37) studio-lab-user@default:~$ python3 -m pip install scipy==1.4\r\nCollecting scipy==1.4\r\n  Downloading scipy-1.4.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (26.1 MB)\r\n     \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 26.1/26.1 MB 62.0 MB/s eta 0:00:00\r\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.13.3 in ./.conda/envs/test37/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scipy==1.4) (1.21.6)\r\nInstalling collected packages: scipy\r\n  Attempting uninstall: scipy\r\n    Found existing installation: scipy 1.7.3\r\n    Uninstalling scipy-1.7.3:\r\n      Successfully uninstalled scipy-1.7.3\r\nERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

That's a downside of slicing packages and I assume that's why big packages tend to bundle all sorts of random things (e.g. have you seen what pytorch bundles? did you know scipy bundles its own version of openblas in the pip package? etc.) so that the failure points are minimized. I tend to argue against this type of thing because it is a pain in conda-forge, but I do realize the benefits of it and I am making an effort to be unbiased here :) \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI have no idea about commercial vs non-commercial nature of stuff, but conda-forge is super-strictly separate from anaconda (at least in my understanding) and they only host our packages on anaconda.org. NVIDIA publishes random things on conda-forge, as well as others, so I usually operate with the assumption that it is a very relaxed community with loose rules. I can probably get someone to weigh on better on this --- some of the core developers at conda-forge have financial ties with companies and they have some policies for these people. As a personal example, I have never personally used any of Anaconda's stuff, and I only use things through conda-forge (and I have no ties to Anaconda at all; I am just a random academic researcher who helps maintain some packages under conda-forge)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nHey! Check out mambaforge :) (mambaforge is miniforge but it comes preinstalled with the mamba solver, which is significantly faster --- and better! --- than the conda solver in miniforge; I believe sooner or later the mamba solver will be adopted into the conda solver though)\n- hawkinsp commented on 2023-12-14T22:43:06Z: In a sense, this JEP has landed!

Closing because the exact design is slightly stale, but we've pretty much delivered on the intent, finally!\n",

The PR contains N/A commits, with 0 additions and 0 deletions across 0 files. \n\nBody: No description available\n\nComments:\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-06-14T16:17:58Z: Hi - thanks for the PR! In the past when we've discussed the polynomial interface, we've made the choice to avoid adding polynomial class types in favor of the more direct functional API (e.g. https://github.com/google/jax/issues/70#issuecomment-907892885). One concern I have here is that when you start to define class-based interfaces, you have to be much more careful to ensure that they're compatible with JAX's transformation model.\r\n\r\nIs there any functionality here that cannot be expressed directly via chebyshev functions, as opposed to a full chebyshev class?\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-14T16:31:46Z: I believe the Chebyshev functions capture all of the functionality, so getting rid of the full class shouldn't cause any problems and would honestly simplify the interface. Would you like me to remove it?\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-06-14T16:39:39Z: I would lean toward keeping only the simplest functional APIs in JAX, partly because it makes long-term maintenance more sustainable (the class definition in this PR is a **gigantic** API surface to test and maintain). But I'm happy to let other team members weigh-in if they disagree.\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-14T19:15:49Z: Alright, I removed the Chebyshev class and its abstract base class to streamline the API. If it's decided later that they are worth including, I have local copies and can add them back in.\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-16T16:24:30Z: Alright, I've cleaned up a lot of the code following your suggestions and to better match the existing polynomial functions in JAX. I've also been thinking more about JAX compatibility, and I wanted to ask a couple questions. The object arrays and value-based shapes were unnecessary, but loop implementations are necessary (or at least the natural way to implement many functions) because of the relationships between terms in a Chebyshev series. \r\n\r\nSo, what do you consider \"large\" for a series or loop parameter? If a typical series is large, would replacing Python control flow  with JAX control flow primitives resolve the incompatibility/inefficiency issues? If so, I will make those changes and then push everything.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-06-16T16:29:28Z: The issue with Python loops is that they are flattened by JAX tracing, and then passed in an unrolled state to the XLA compiler. The mechanics of the compiler are complicated, but a good rule of thumb is that compilation time will be roughly quadratic in the number of operations. So if you write a Python `for` loop over 100 elements, then compilation will be roughly 10000 times more costly than the equivalent `fori_loop` implementation. There's not really any hard line regarding what size the loops should be, but if you expect the functions to operate on larger inputs, it's something to keep in mind. Does that make sense?\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-16T16:32:29Z: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you!\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-20T19:41:28Z: Ok, I've removed all Python loops from chebyshev.py and replaced them with JAX control flow primitives. I've also cleaned up most of the functions to make them less convoluted where possible. Is there anything else you would like me to do?\r\nThank you!\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-06-21T16:36:11Z: Thanks. Another big piece of adding this kind of functionality is testing \u2013 before we can merge this, we'll need full test coverage of the functionality. If it's helpful, you can base it off of existing tests in https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/tests/polynomial_test.py. Let me know if you have questions about that!\r\n\r\nAlso, just FYI we have some work in progress that will add some constraints to this code (see #10840): essentially, JAX library code will no longer be able to rely on implicit dtype promotion once that is merged. You can run your tests locally with that condition by setting the flag value `JAX_NUMPY_DTYPE_PROMOTION=strict`\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-22T16:15:10Z: Alright, I have a couple questions. First of all, many NumPy Chebyshev functions trim trailing zeros before returning, a feature I omitted from the JAX versions for jit compatibility. When comparing against NumPy, should I just wrap JAX-based versions of these functions in a trimzeros function, or is there a better way to test that ignores length differences? \r\n\r\nSecond, what is the desired behavior for functions under the new dtype promotion constraints? Should functions like chebadd raise an error if the input arrays have different dtypes, should they attempt explicit dtype promotion, or should they do something else?\r\n\r\nThank you!\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-06-22T22:42:45Z: Excellent question - one strategy we typically use in this situation (where the numpy behavior is incompatible with JIT) is to add an additional keyword argument, set so that the default value matches the behavior of numpy, and so that it can be changed to modify the API to be compatible with JIT (you can see an example in the `strip_zeros` keyword to `jnp.roots`, which I just finished revamping in #11215)\r\n\r\nI think you could use a very similar treatment here.\r\n\r\nRegarding dtypes: the rule of thumb is that if a dtype mismatch comes from two arrays passed by the user, you should let the error through. If it comes from the implementation (e.g. you do something like `x + jnp.arange(x.shape[-1])` and it errors because `x` is float32) then you should adjust the implementation to be compatible with strict promotion. Does that make sense?\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-22T23:18:24Z: Yes, that all makes sense. Thank you!\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-24T15:20:45Z: I've finished writing the Chebyshev tests, and they can all pass - with some caveats. The output of some functions (chebpow, chebfit, chebval, chebroots) can have mismatched values further apart than the tolerance of 1e-6 that I've been using, especially for higher-order inputs. Are there ways to make JAX output better match NumPy output, or are those numerical differences unavoidable?\r\n\r\nSecond, some tests can also fail in cases where NumPy warns but still returns output matching the JAX output. How should I handle these cases?\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-06-24T15:41:35Z: Regarding precision \u2013 I suspect this is due to JAX executing in float32, while numpy executes in float64. You can execute the tests with `JAX_ENABLE_X64=true` to get 64-bit execution\r\n\r\nRegarding warnings - you can filter them if they're expected. You can see examples of this elsewhere in the tests, e.g. https://github.com/google/jax/blob/4c25ef1d0039ecdd517ce2b09605322797700c2a/tests/lax_numpy_test.py#L579-L584\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-27T16:13:32Z: Ok, all test pass with JAX_ENABLE_x64=true and JAX_NUMPY_DTYPE_PROMOTION=strict. I also updated applicable functions with a \"trim\" keyword argument so that they match NumPy behavior by default. What's the next step?\r\nThank you!\n- gderossi commented on 2022-06-29T16:08:30Z: Implemented the changes you requested, and hopefully fixed what caused the chebcompanion test to fail last time.\n- gderossi commented on 2022-07-11T16:03:41Z: Made the changes you requested. Also, the Chebyshev test suite takes 75-80 seconds to run on my laptop using the command you provided. \n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-11T16:31:35Z: That's a bit concerning, to be quite honest: currently our CI jobs run in about 20-30 minutes, so this PR would be adding 3-5% testing overhead for a single new API. Our strategy for avoiding test timeouts is generally to reduce `NUM_GENERATED_CASES` globally once we start hitting timeout limits... I'm not sure it makes sense to reduce our package-wide test coverage by 5% in order to add a few chebyshev polynomial routines that probably only a handful of users will ever use.\r\n\r\nThis is a tricky one, I'm not sure what to recommend...\n- gderossi commented on 2022-07-12T20:11:01Z: After some more testing, I believe the Chebyshev tests actually contribute a much smaller percentage of total testing time: I ran the full test suite on my laptop yesterday, and it took about 2 hours and 18 minutes, or ~8300 seconds. Running the Chebyshev test file individually took 75-80 seconds, which is 0.9-1% of the total. I just ran the test suite remotely on a much more powerful computer, which completed all the tests in 1270 seconds and the Chebyshev tests alone in 11 seconds, which is ~0.866% of the total.\r\nI'm happy to repeat these tests or try other tests you think would be helpful to verify this ratio. 1% of the testing overhead is still significant, so I've also experimented with reducing the Chebyshev tests, as I noticed that polynomial_tests.py only includes tests for jnp.roots. \r\nMany of the cheb* functions call other cheb* functions - for example, chebpow calls chebadd, so the chebadd tests could potentially be removed. Changes that break chebadd would (hopefully) be caught by the chebpow tests. Another category of functions, the 2d and 3d versions of chebval/chebgrid/chebvander, are simply wrappers for nested calls of the respective 1d functions. Tests for these could also be removed, as the 1d function tests should cover everything.\r\nRemoving tests for all functions that fall under the two categories described above cuts the time of the Chebyshev tests in half, and a majority of this cost is due to only a few functions: chebfit, chebdiv, and chebfromroots. Reducing the number of test cases for these particular functions or eliminating tests for them entirely could significantly speed up the Chebyshev tests.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, let me know what you think!\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-18T20:46:43Z: Thanks - that makes sense. Let's go ahead and merge this and we can deal with any test timeout issues separately. Thanks for all the work here!\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-18T21:26:38Z: The test failures here look real: it looks like `chebgrid` does some implicit type promotion when it is passed integer inputs.\n- gderossi commented on 2022-07-18T22:21:31Z: Ok, should be fixed now. All tests are passing locally for every combination of  JAX_ENABLE_X64 and JAX_NUMPY_DTYPE_PROMOTION.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-19T16:18:00Z: On some further internal testing, the new tests show a number of failures. First, since nonsymmetric eigendecomposition is not implemented for GPU or TPU, the tests need to be skipped on those backends. Second, there's a strange failure that looks to be due to an invalid input to the numpy reference function:\r\n```\r\nTestChebyshev.testChebroots_dtype=int32[5]\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"absl/testing/parameterized.py\", line 312, in bound_param_test\r\n    return test_method(self, **testcase_params)\r\n  File \"jax/tests/chebyshev_test.py\", line 445, in testChebroots\r\n    self._CompileAndCheck(jnp_fn, args_maker)\r\n  File \"/jax/_src/test_util.py\", line 846, in _CompileAndCheck\r\n    python_ans = fun(*args)\r\n  File \"jax/_src/numpy/polynomials/chebyshev.py\", line 634, in chebroots\r\n    return _chebroots(c)\r\nSystemError: <CompiledFunction of <function _chebroots at 0x7fce1424aa60>> returned a result with an error set\r\n```\n- gderossi commented on 2022-07-19T18:31:41Z: Ok, the chebroots test is now skipped on GPU and TPU.

How should this work here? I think the answer will depend on how customizable JAX's logging is supposed to be in the end, for example if logfile writes could be an option in the future for computation runs. Happy to hear your thoughts - especially on the general direction of the implementation here.~\r\n\r\nEDIT: I implemented `jax.logging.vlog` as a cross-platform API.

What do you think?\r\n\r\nDefinitely to be avoided, in my opinion. I was unaware of this, but I could see that symbols taken from an imported module are not updated upon module reload. The other option, only ever using the `jax.logging` import and never any function-level imports from it, seems like a pretty big restriction on the user to me.\r\n\r\n> If we wanted to, could we change the implementation to make this behave analogously to your initial example (namely, respecting the dynamic change in config setting)?\r\n\r\nJudging from browsing SO on Python hot reloading for a couple of minutes, the logging member imports in the caller module need to be reloaded as well. I do not exactly know if/how that is possible, but the machinery probably exists. My guess is it would most likely be the current solution plus a lookup of any imported `jax.logging` module members in the \"right place\" (where exactly is TBD), and, if found, their reimport.\r\n\r\nFor your reference: A good SO thread I found on this (because of an illustrative code example) is [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1739924/python-reload-component-y-imported-with-from-x-import-y); the example from the Python REPL there indicates the difference between whole-module imports and \"dotted\" (module member) imports, where the latter requires the second `from X import Y` statement for a successful reload.\r\n\r\nSo if we find a way to emulate the second import statement from the config update hook, we should be good to go.\n- froystig commented on 2022-10-03T20:27:51Z: Also for reference, based on a quick test, [PEP 562](https://peps.python.org/pep-0562/) (`__getattr__` on modules) will not help us here either.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to handle all module-level functions, like `logging.warning`, by defining each one as a function that switches on the config setting to call the corresponding selected implementation (standard `warning` or absl `warning`). The remaining challenge is to handle the non-callable attributes. From what I can tell, all of these are logging level integers, such as `logging.DEBUG`.\r\n\r\nCould we simply choose not to support the vlog parts of the logging interface (`vlog` and `vlog_is_on`), and instead maintain a habit of only calling `logging.info`, `logging.warning`, etc. directly?\r\n\r\n@jakevdp @skye @hawkinsp any thoughts?\n- froystig commented on 2022-10-04T19:55:36Z: Related discussion in #12651 \n- nicholasjng commented on 2022-10-04T20:25:08Z: Cool. I initially even planned to do it this way, but I got discouraged by the boilerplate that this added for supporting the whole logging interface.\r\nI also opted to keep the `vlog` usage to make the change less disruptive and allow smooth adoption, but I personally think the discussed `logging.debug/info/...` APIs should be plenty - happy to change that, after a quick discussion on what the `CPP_{WARNING,ERROR}` levels should become.\r\n\r\nAs for the integers, we _could_ just use `logging`'s version of the constants, and set up a level conversion mechanism for absl APIs similar to ABSL's internal conversion of levels in `absl.log`, where we need to. But are you sure that the `if` branch there does not suffice? (I thought it might end up working like a C++ preprocessor directive)\n- froystig commented on 2022-10-10T23:55:31Z: I discussed this a bit with @hawkinsp and @shoyer. Now that we understand the costs better, we think it's worthwhile to simplify things and just drop absl logging altogether, rather than continue trying to support both logging packages via a common interface. To do that, we'll need to migrate the jax codebase further. And while we're at it, we should also avoid using the builtin `'root'` Python logger (cf. #12526). Here's how I suspect this could go:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a global internal logger instance, which we can name `'jax'`.\r\n2. Since `vlog` will no longer be available, replace current uses of `vlog` with calls to the corresponding `logging.{debug,warning,info,...}` on the `'jax'` logger.\r\n3. Similarly, replace current uses of `vlog_is_on` with equivalent logic from Python's `logging`, e.g. using [`isEnabledFor()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.isEnabledFor) and [`getEffectiveLevel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.getEffectiveLevel). Note that Python logging skips string interpolation if you format with positional arguments, so some current uses of `vlog_is_on` can maybe be removed entirely, if the interpolation cost is all that they are guarding. (See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#optimization) and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#formatting-styles).)\r\n4. Migrate `log` calls as well, so that we only use the `'jax'` non-root logger.\r\n5. Drop `absl` logging entirely.\r\n\r\nWe would probably no longer need a `jax.logging` module. We could consider adding an internal `jax._src.logging` for any utilities that make things easier to manage, if the need for them arises while working on the changes above.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nOf course, let us know if this seems like more than what you'd like to take on at this point, or if you'd like to handle only a subset of such changes in this PR.\n- skye commented on 2022-10-11T00:08:11Z: Hey sorry for not responding earlier! The key thing I like about vlog is that you can specify a vmodule to only print vlogs from a certain file. This is way better than printing all debug logging, which is often way too verbose. vlog also has the feature of introducing arbitrary debug levels, so you can control the verbosity even within a file. This is pretty useful as well, but not as critical as the per-module logging IMO.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like we should be able to do this with Python logging as well though? Maybe by specifying a different logger for each file/module? I'm in general in favor of dropping absl logging because it barely works in Python (e.g. I only know how to set a Python vmodule when running inside Google).\n- froystig commented on 2022-10-11T00:59:21Z: I was thinking that we can look into introducing more fine-grained loggers after we migrate (e.g. one per file or module, etc.). That way we keep things simple for a transition PR and then experiment with further changes afterwards (also e.g. trying custom formatters).\r\n\r\nWe might have to write a bit of code to reinstate a few absl-like behaviors that we like, but it seems that would still be the preferred eventual situation.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2022-10-11T01:09:07Z: @skye The idiom that a lot of folks seem to use is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport logging\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\nlogger.debug(\"hello\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis plays a role similar to `vlog` and `vmodule`, because in another file you can turn up the verbosity of that specific module's logs like this:\r\n```\r\nimport logging\r\nl = logging.getLogger(\"jax.core\")\r\nl.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\r\n```\r\ni.e., you can enable debug logs on a per-module basis.\r\n\r\nI would probably migrate the `vlog` uses to use that idiom right now.\n- nicholasjng commented on 2022-10-11T06:41:45Z: Sounds good! I'll work on implementing your list when I get time, I expect it could work out this week.\r\n\r\nAs for the vlog/vmodule substitution, I think I will go with @hawkinsp's suggestion, and then make a global `jax` logger available somewhere.\r\n\r\nBy the way, would you support dropping `absl-py` as a package install requirement? It can probably stay for testing, but I think there was some interest for eliminating that dependency (ping @josephrocca).\n- froystig commented on 2022-10-11T16:12:40Z: > As for the vlog/vmodule substitution, I think I will go with @hawkinsp's suggestion, and then make a global `jax` logger available somewhere.\r\n\r\nSounds good. Do we need both? What would the global `'jax'` logger be used for at that point?\r\n\r\n> By the way, would you support dropping `absl-py` as a package install requirement? It can probably stay for testing, but I think there was some interest for eliminating that dependency (ping @josephrocca).\r\n\r\nYes, good idea. We still support [absl flags](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/05faf0f40d376afccd9c3e957fe811b4c839aed5/jax/_src/config.py#L137) optionally, but we can make this a soft dependency: works if absl is installed, doesn't otherwise.\r\n\r\nOur tests use it, but it doesn't need to be an install requirement for jax. We may need to add it to [build/test-requirements.txt](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/build/test-requirements.txt).\n- nicholasjng commented on 2022-10-11T16:19:49Z: Sweet. Then I am good to go, except for one proposal. What do you think about adding a small `get_logger` facility in, say, the top-level `jax` namespace? Makes for easy-to-remember code (think `logger = jax.get_logger(...)`, similar to @hawkinsp's example up top), and, maybe even nicer, would allow for some default values controllable by environment variables. \r\n\r\nI have a quick example [here](https://github.com/nicholasjng/pybm/blob/master/pybm/logging.py) from a personal project of mine; the `config.get_value(foo)` calls there could be `FLAGS.foo` for some newly added options (e.g. logfile, loglevel etc) in the JAX setting.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, in that case, the proposed \"jax\" logger would be equal to the module-level logger for the `jax` top-level namespace, so the module-level solution is a perfect superset of the global one. \n- froystig commented on 2022-10-11T21:37:09Z: > What do you think about adding a small `get_logger` facility in, say, the top-level `jax` namespace?

Useful utilities are a fine idea in general.

This is not a good general idea as in some cases it will backfire and lead to poor performance, but would help jax2tf. As for tflite, tflite.experimental_from_jax should just apply the optimisation pass to simplify scatters (I will add this as a separate issue). \r\n\r\nI think this pull request should only apply to jax2tf (I'll make the necessary code changes) and only when `enable_xla=False` is enabled. This flag suggests the exit point will not be XLA compiled and hence these simplifications improve support and probably performance.\n- oliverdutton commented on 2022-05-16T22:13:18Z: This is now a companion PR request to #10653.

Improving JAX trace times is a great goal! That said, at first blush, I'm not convinced that microbenchmarks at this level are the best way to approach reducing JAX's overhead. Yes it's a ~30% improvement in runtime, but that improvement amounts to ~30\u00b5s per run when parsing 1000 static and 1000 dynamic indices, which I suspect is far more than are ever parsed in practice. If we assume the savings is linear in the number of parsed indices, then I expect the typical savings for a real use-case would be perhaps tens of nanoseconds for a typical gather operation. That's not zero, but I don't think it's something worth dwelling on in the overall computational cost of executing a JAX program.\r\n\r\nNow I may be wrong... it would be interesting to see a line profiler output of a typical JAX computation, and see which operations are contributing the most. If `_merge_static_and_dynamic_indices` is high in that, then this may be a good change to consider.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2023-03-04T18:15:10Z: Closing as stale.\n",

Maybe then it is more important to keep an effects flag for eqn.\r\n\r\nThat could work.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, I'm trying to think of effects as encoded on the arrow types. A JaxprType (which we don't have an explicit object for in main JAX, though there is one in Autodidax), being an arrow type, would thus include what effects it has (in addition to the input and output types). Likewise a parameterized primitive (e.g. a cond_p with particular branch jaxprs) would have such a type.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of efficiently querying and checking types, we might want to add explicit annotations to the jaxpr syntax (i.e. data structure). For that purpose it seems we could arguably put these annotations wherever we find convenient. I first put them on jaxprs so we wouldn't have to recurse into sub-jaxprs when querying the type of a jaxpr. But having them on eqns would serve that purpose also, and has a nice correspondence to how they're computed (i.e. to abstract eval rules).\r\n\r\nI'll give that a shot and see what happens!\r\n\r\n> Nit: wdyt about renaming effects to has_effects\r\n\r\nLove it!\n- mattjj commented on 2021-12-01T23:41:00Z: Ah, I remembered why I called it `effects` and not `has_effects`: we expect to generalize this to a set of effects rather than just a boolean.

I think this would be convenient (especially, e.g., for type checking), but this might have backwards compatibility implications if we ever switch to JAX transformation based approaches (constructors for tracer objects are not external APIs).\r\n- Are `wrap`/`unwrap` the right names for the function transforms? And should their names perhaps be flipped? Other options: `tree_wrap`/`tree_unwrap`, `vectorize`/`unvectorize`, `tree_vectorize`/`tree_unvectorize`, `map`/`unmap` (similar to `vmap`, but possibly confusing to the pre-existing `tree_utils.tree_map`), `vector_to_tree_func`/`tree_to_vector_func`, `autotree`/`undotree` ...\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2021-11-11T00:53:13Z: This is awesome.  Should we favor writing algorithms for trees then and pass them to `tree_math`?\n- shoyer commented on 2021-11-11T01:14:55Z: > Should we favor writing algorithms for trees then and pass them to `tree_math`?\r\n\r\nBy \"favor writing algorithms for trees\" did you mean to say \"favor writing algorithms for vectors\"?\r\n\r\nWriting algorithms for vectors would definitely be my favored approach. Code for vectors is much more readable than code for pytrees (mostly due to support for infix arithmetic). When transformed with `tree_math` it will work for pytrees, too, and under `jit` performance should be identical to writing the transformations by hand.\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2021-11-11T01:31:18Z: > By \"favor writing algorithms for trees\" did you mean to say \"favor writing algorithms for vectors\"?\r\n\r\nYes, sorry.\r\n\r\n> Writing algorithms for vectors would definitely be my favored approach\r\n\r\nSounds great.  This feature is a fantastic addition in my opinion \ud83d\ude04 \n- Edenhofer commented on 2021-11-19T21:02:45Z: For a lot of algorithms one would also need an implementation of `dot` (or `vdot`) for `Vector`s. There is some ambiguity here concerning the axis of the tensors of the Vector but it would be a great addition to `matmul`.\n- shoyer commented on 2021-11-19T21:47:41Z: > For a lot of algorithms one would also need an implementation of `dot` (or `vdot`) for `Vector`s. There is some ambiguity here concerning the axis of the tensors of the Vector but it would be a great addition to `matmul`.\r\n\r\nThe version of \"matmul\" that I implemented only work on vectors, so it's exactly the same as `np.dot` (\"tree matrices\" hasn't been implemented yet). So we could either include an alias `dot = matmul` or encourage using the infix notation `u @ v`.\n- Edenhofer commented on 2021-11-19T22:21:16Z: Sorry for the noise! I was too hasty when looking at the implementation :|\r\nI think an alias would be nice but I don't have any strong feelings about any of the two options.\n- Edenhofer commented on 2021-11-23T15:30:42Z: I hope this comment is more qualified than my last one :|\r\n\r\nI basically built a very similar class a while ago and happened to find the following convenience methods quite useful. Both method names also exist in numpy and these functions are straight-forward extensions of numpy-methods to pytreees.\r\n```python\r\ndef size(tree, axis: Optional[int] = None) -> Union[int, jnp.ndarray]:\r\n    if axis is not None:\r\n        raise TypeError(\"axis of an arbitrary tree is ill defined\")\r\n    sizes = tree_map(jnp.size, tree)\r\n    return tree_reduce(jnp.add, sizes)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef norm(tree, ord, *, ravel: bool = True):\r\n    from jax.numpy.linalg import norm\r\n\r\n    if ravel:\r\n\r\n        def el_norm(x):\r\n            return jnp.abs(x) if jnp.ndim(x) == 0 else norm(x.ravel(), ord=ord)\r\n    else:\r\n\r\n        def el_norm(x):\r\n            return jnp.abs(x) if jnp.ndim(x) == 0 else norm(x, ord=ord)\r\n\r\n    return norm(tree_leaves(tree_map(el_norm, tree)), ord=ord)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, `size` does the same thing as `Vector.__len__` (using `np.size(x) = np.prod(np.shape(x))`) but I prefer to use the former since `assert size(Vector(x)) == size(x)` would hold for any tensor while `assert len(Vector(x)) != len(x)`. In your implementation this is of course intentional. However, I find that I almost never want the length of the first axis and instead need the number of elements in the tensor so I use `size` for tensors and pytrees alike.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I also overload `__getitem__` and `__contains__`. I use these helper methods to e.g. access elements of a math-enabled dictionary but really anything would work as long as `Vector._tree` implements these methods.\r\n\r\nSurely not all helper methods are worth having upstream, but since JAX is experimenting with enabling numerics for pytrees, I though I would share these. I assume overloading `__getitem__` and `__contains__` is a bit too specific to my use case but maybe others might find these methods useful as well.\r\n\r\nEDIT: `Vector.dot` is also one of those methods which I found convenient to have. It as well is part of the numpy.ndarray API and thus works for tensors and `Vector`s alike.\n- shoyer commented on 2021-11-23T16:19:24Z: I'll add a `size` property and `dot` method, those are basically aliases for existing functionality.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure `__getitem__` makes sense. Indexing like `x[y]` on a vector `x` could only work when the indexing object `y` is a Python integer:\r\n- There's no unambiguous way to know the underlying pytree structure for slicing like `x[:3]`.\r\n- Indexing with a JAX tracer doesn't work, because we need to know which array is being indexed from Python to generate do efficient indexing. This means we couldn't looping over an index variable, e.g., with `lax.fori_loop`.\r\n- This leaves indexing like `x[0]` or `x[-1]`. I can see this being handy for debugging, but I can also see it misleadingly suggesting that general purpose indexing work.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you're using `__contains__` for, but generally that overload does not make sense on multi-dimensional arrays. It also needs to return a Python builtin `bool`, which is rather restrictive. JAX does not implement it on its other array types and so I doubt it makes sense here, either.\n- Edenhofer commented on 2021-11-23T17:31:00Z: Great, thanks!\r\n\r\nIs `norm` also of interest or is it already too specific? It comes in handy for implementing convergence criteria in some minimization schemes which use e.g. the 1-norm or allow the user to set the order of the norm freely.\r\n\r\nSure, in general slicing does not work nor would a loop over all elements work efficiently. However, I don't use it for that. Most of the thinks I wrap end up being nested dictionaries of some sort and I forward `__contains__` and `__getitem__` on to the underlying object. Thus, `math_enabled_dict[some_key]` still accesses the underlying dictionary and yields whatever is at `some_key`.\r\n\r\nMy philosophy behind this decision was that whatever I wrap in a math-enabled pytree should still behave and act exactly as the un-wrapped object with the only constrain being that whatever method I implemented must also work for numpy arrays. For my implementation this means that `Vector(some_jnp_array)` behaves exactly the same as its un-wrapper counterpart. This might be overly specific to my use-case and might not fit the here-proposed `Vector` class. If so, feel free to disregard my comments on this topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n>  JAX does not implement it on its other array types and so I doubt it makes sense here, either.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what you mean by this; `assert 3 in jnp.arange(4)`  does work.\n- shoyer commented on 2021-11-23T17:43:19Z: > Is `norm` also of interest or is it already too specific? It comes in handy for implementing convergence criteria in some minimization schemes which use e.g. the 1-norm or allow the user to set the order of the norm freely.\r\n\r\n`norm` is not a method on numpy arrays. My current approach is that the functionality of `tree_math.Vector` should be a strict subset of the functionality of normal JAX/NumPy arrays.\r\n\r\nInstead you could use infix arithmetic like `(x @ x) ** 0.5`.\r\n\r\n> Sure, in general slicing does not work nor would a loop over all elements work efficiently.

Thus, `math_enabled_dict[some_key]` still accesses the underlying dictionary and yields whatever is at `some_key`.\r\n\r\nAh, I see. I'd like tree_math to be entirely explicit, and _strictly_ allow for manipulating pytrees as if they were 1D NumPy arrays. If you want to do this sort of access, you can pull out the underlying Pytree with the `.tree` attribute and then make a new `Vector`.\r\n\r\n> > JAX does not implement it on its other array types and so I doubt it makes sense here, either.\r\n> \r\n> I am not sure what you mean by this; `assert 3 in jnp.arange(4)` does work.\r\n\r\nThis is Python's fallback implementation of `__contains__`, via iteration with `__iter__`: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__\r\n\r\nWe could certainly support `__iter__` on `tree_math.Vector`. It won't be very efficient, but I guess not much worse than iterating over normal JAX arrays.\n- Edenhofer commented on 2021-11-23T18:16:06Z: > `norm` is not a method on numpy arrays. My current approach is that the functionality of `tree_math.Vector` should be a strict subset of the functionality of normal JAX/NumPy arrays.\r\n\r\nRight, I got that from your implementation. Just to be clear, my proposal was to add `norm` as an additional function to `experimental.tree_math` in the same way `matmul` is exposed as function as well.\r\n\r\nI think you also misunderstood this aspect of the proposed `size` function. Of course having it as a method of `Vector` works too but I think it would also be a great addition to `experimental.tree_math`. Similar to `matmul`, `size` and `norm` both make sense for general pytrees.\r\n\r\n> Instead you could use infix arithmetic like (x @ x) ** 0.5.\r\n\r\nSure, I can of course implement any desired p-norm by hand but I find `norm(x, ord=p)` to be more convenient.\r\n\r\n> This is Python's fallback implementation of __contains__, via iteration with __iter__: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__\r\n\r\nAh, I see. Thank for the explanation!\n- shoyer commented on 2021-11-23T18:29:49Z: > Similar to `matmul`, `size` and `norm` both make sense for general pytrees.\r\n\r\nJust to be entirely clear, the functions implemented in tree_math don't work for general pytrees -- they only work for explicit `tree_math.Vector` objects. The only reason why I created `matmul` is that it gives a way to explicitly set the `precision` argument, which you can't do with infix notation. In general, I would rather encourage using methods than functions, because the methods will let you write portable code that also works on regular JAX arrays.\r\n\r\n`norm` seems fine to add, but let's save that for a follow-on PR after this gets merged.\n- Edenhofer commented on 2021-11-23T18:47:04Z: Ok. Thank you for all the explanations and of course for implementing it in the first place :)\n- PhilipVinc commented on 2021-12-01T17:53:00Z: thanks!\n- shoyer commented on 2021-12-29T00:57:40Z: We decided to implement this as a separate library outside of JAX for now.

For example `jax.jit(f).hlo(a, b, c)` and `jax.jit(f).compile(a, b, c).hlo()`.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage of capturing the configuration @soraros points out (e.g. num_replicas) in the same way the outer API.\r\n\r\nShould we implement that instead?\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-08-26T16:13:42Z: That's a good thought! It's a bit more involved to implement, though, because for JIT the compiled function object is defined in C++, so implementing this as an attribute there would require a C++ implementation in jaxlib rather than a simpler Python utility.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-08-26T16:16:20Z: ... or maybe it could be monkey-patched.\n- froystig commented on 2021-08-26T20:54:34Z: What @tomhennigan is referring to is now tracked as #7733. We could merge this PR (or whatever similar PR) as is. When the work on #7733 is complete, the implementation here can change to use it.\r\n\r\nOverall I think the idea here is to provide a simple utility to handle a special\u2014and maybe very common\u2014case of AOT lowering. I'd encourage us to pick what arguments to offer/hide here on that principle. #7733 will ideally offer the full menu of options.\n- soraros commented on 2021-08-28T01:34:44Z: If this PR only deals with the printing part(as it returns a string), I think having an extra `print_option` argument would be helpful.

Those `isinstance` checks look great, but why doesn't `issubclass` work the same way?\r\n```python\r\nIn [4]: issubclass(jnp.ndarray, np.ndarray)\r\nOut[4]: True\r\n\r\nIn [5]: issubclass(np.ndarray, jnp.ndarray)\r\nOut[5]: False\r\n```\r\nThis is what MyPy sees:\r\n```python\r\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nz = np.zeros(4)\r\n\r\ndef f(x: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:\r\n    return x\r\n\r\nf(z)  # error: Argument 1 to \"f\" has incompatible type \"numpy.ndarray\"; expected \"jax._src.numpy.lax_numpy.ndarray\"\r\n```\r\nThis works fine if we do it the other way around.

There's also the issue that when tracing functions, jax passes `Tracer` objects in place of arrays, so the `np.ndarray` type will fail there I suspect. We've not yet landed on any way to have meaningful mypy-compatible type annotations for traceable arguements to JAX functions.\r\n\r\nIf you want to fix this, I'd suggest doing what we do elsewhere: set `Array = Any` and annotate it with type `Array`.

I think the only option then would be to unconditionally return complex values, but zero-out the imaginary part if it's small.

What do you think?\n- lgeiger commented on 2021-04-30T23:15:39Z: That is a fair point.

I think there are contexts in which referring to lambda by the name \"rate\" is more typical than referring to it by the name \"scale\", so it's not clear to me that this change should be made. For example, the Wikipedia article on the [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) calls this parameter the \"expected rate of occurrances\".\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2021-04-01T18:02:59Z: @jakevdp Yeah, I actually thought of that when I suggested the change.  You are right that the rate of Poisson process (lambda) is modeled by a Poisson distribution whose mean is lambda.  However, the terms [_scale parameter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_parameter) and [_rate parameter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_parameter#Rate_parameter) are technical terms.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the Wikipedia article for the Poisson distribution does call lambda, the \"rate\".  On the other hand, a Google scholar search for \"Poisson distribution\" and \"scale parameter\" turns up more hits than \"Poisson distribution\" and \"rate paramter\".\r\n\r\nUp to you, I don't mind either way.  I just found it confusing to call it a \"rate parameter\", but I guess it's my fault for not reading the brackets that say it's the mean.\n- NeilGirdhar commented on 2021-04-01T18:07:15Z: Meh, I should have read more carefully. :)\n",

Ultimately we'd rather not require an actual array for `x` when it isn't needed, and we still need to strengthen the checks that `g` is called in a compatible way.\n- litanlitudan commented on 2021-09-13T04:52:29Z: This is very cool!!! Also very useful for some DSA compiler projects as a lot of lower-level compilation is very slow. Having an AOT interface would make a lot of sense. If we can also specify the path of the compiled binary file, that would be even better. \n- hawkinsp commented on 2021-11-29T15:46:36Z: Closing because it is most likely subsumed by the version of the API that is checked in.\n",

The PR contains N/A commits, with 0 additions and 0 deletions across 0 files. \n\nBody: No description available\n\nComments:\n- shoyer commented on 2020-10-07T04:52:45Z: We _could_ do this, but I would lean towards preserving NumPy's interface for `matmul` and leaving advanced manipulations like this to `einsum` (which lowers to a mix of `dot_general` and `transpose`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `einsum` doesn't do the desired thing here -- instead it adds another transpose afterwards:\r\n```\r\n>>> jax.make_jaxpr(lambda a, b: jnp.einsum('ij,kj->ik', a, b))(a, b)\r\n{ lambda  ; a b.\r\n  let c = xla_call[ backend=None\r\n                    call_jaxpr={ lambda  ; a b.\r\n                                 let c = dot_general[ dimension_numbers=(((1,), (1,)), ((), ()))\r\n                                                      precision=None ] b a\r\n                                     d = transpose[ permutation=(1, 0) ] c\r\n                                 in (d,) }\r\n                    device=None\r\n                    donated_invars=(False, False)\r\n                    name=_einsum ] a b\r\n  in (c,) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could possibly be improved with some digging, however.\n- antoniojkim commented on 2020-10-07T13:28:16Z: @shoyer Adding the optional transpose functionality does to a certain degree preserve the NumPy interface as all new arguments have default values and were positionally added to the end. No previous usages of the `matmul` function would have to change. Only going forward, the user would have slightly more control over the contraction dimensions than before. The motivation for doing this obviously would be that TensorFlow exposes this functionality in it's [`matmul`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/matmul) function.\r\n\r\nI still think it's a good idea to do this. What are your thoughts?\n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-10-07T14:56:36Z: Another reason that it doesn't necessarily make sense to add functionality like `transpose` to `matmul` is that in JAX you have the freedom to form these kinds of composite ops using `jit`.\r\n\r\ne.g., you can easily write things like\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_matmul = jax.jit(lambda x, y: x @ y.T)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think \"fewer instructions\" is necessarily a good metric for better or worse code; under a `jit`, XLA will perform whole-program optimizations, and it may end up fusing the transpose with the dot anyway.\n- antoniojkim commented on 2020-10-07T15:26:17Z: @hawkinsp its not about fewer instructions per-say. It's about performance. I submitted the PR because I found the change to have quite a bit of performance impact with large matrices. Sometimes the `jax.jit` operator does not optimize these out enough. e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = np.random.random((7, 2, 3))\r\n>>> b = np.random.random((7, 2, 3))\r\n>>> my_matmul = jax.jit(lambda x, y: jnp.matmul(x, jnp.transpose(y, [0, 2, 1])))\r\n>>> jax.make_jaxpr(my_matmul)(a, b)\r\n{ lambda  ; a b.\r\n  let c = xla_call[ backend=None\r\n                    call_jaxpr={ lambda  ; a b.\r\n                                 let c = transpose[ permutation=(0, 2, 1) ] b\r\n                                     d = dot_general[ dimension_numbers=(((2,), (1,)), ((0,), (0,)))\r\n                                                      precision=None ] a c\r\n                                 in (d,) }\r\n                    device=None\r\n                    donated_invars=(False, False)\r\n                    name=<lambda> ] a b\r\n  in (c,) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly, the jit did not optimize out the transpose in favour of changing the `dot_general` contraction dimensions. The additional explicit transpose can have performance implications, especially if the transposed matrix multiplication is used frequently and on large matrices.\r\n\r\n> XLA will perform whole-program optimizations, and it may end up fusing the transpose with the dot anyway.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, while this _can_ happen, it does not always reliably do so. Having the option to explicitly change the contraction dimensions just makes it a lot easier and more reliable.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-10-07T15:48:32Z: `jax.make_jaxpr` shows JAX IR before optimization, so I wouldn't expect it to have any transpose/dot folding.\r\n\r\nIf you want to view the optimized XLA HLO (note: internal API use):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> print(jax.lib.xla_bridge.get_backend().compile(jax.xla_computation(my_matmul)(a, b)).hlo_modules()[0].to_string())\r\nHloModule xla_computation__lambda___6.14\r\n\r\nENTRY %xla_computation__lambda___6.14 (parameter.1: f32[7,2,3], parameter.2: f32[7,2,3]) -> (f32[7,2,2]) {\r\n  %parameter.1 = f32[7,2,3]{2,1,0} parameter(0)\r\n  %parameter.2 = f32[7,2,3]{2,1,0} parameter(1)\r\n  %transpose = f32[7,3,2]{2,1,0} transpose(f32[7,2,3]{2,1,0} %parameter.2), dimensions={0,2,1}, metadata={op_type=\"transpose\" op_name=\"xla_computation(<lambda>)/jit(<lambda>)/transpose[ permutation=(0, 2, 1) ]\" source_file=\"<ipython-input-44-e6e04a279036>\" source_line=3}\r\n  %dot = f32[7,2,2]{2,1,0} dot(f32[7,2,3]{2,1,0} %parameter.1, f32[7,3,2]{2,1,0} %transpose), lhs_batch_dims={0}, lhs_contracting_dims={2}, rhs_batch_dims={0}, rhs_contracting_dims={1}, metadata={op_type=\"dot_general\" op_name=\"xla_computation(<lambda>)/jit(<lambda>)/dot_general[ dimension_numbers=(((2,), (1,)), ((0,), (0,)))\\n                                                     precision=None ]\" source_file=\"<ipython-input-44-e6e04a279036>\" source_line=3}\r\n  ROOT %tuple.13 = (f32[7,2,2]{2,1,0}) tuple(f32[7,2,2]{2,1,0} %dot)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case you are right: XLA's CPU backend has not chosen to fuse the transpose with the `dot`. I filed a bug with the XLA folks, given that the underlying kernel does support fused transposes.\r\n\r\n(By contrast, on TPU, XLA will fuse these operations, particularly if the matrices are larger.)\r\n\r\nI'd also agree with @shoyer that we want to be cautious about extending NumPy's API. It's possible we could change `einsum` to try even harder to avoid adding a transpose to the output.\n- antoniojkim commented on 2020-10-07T16:09:04Z: @hawkinsp That is fine. If the API change is a big deal, I'll just change the contraction dimensions explicitly in my code.

Is there a ticket for getting it implemented for batched matrix multiplications? Especially when it comes to high-performance ML, having fast batched operations is ideal. While it is possible to implement this functionality manually by explicitly calling `lax.dot_general` and specifying the contraction dimensions, it would be nice if it was conveniently exposed in a higher level numpy-like function.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-10-08T13:59:48Z: I've reported a bug and hopefully they will fix it.

We would also need a way to list all the harnesses. \r\n\r\n\n- hawkinsp commented on 2023-03-04T17:58:18Z: Closing as stale.\n",

So long as trax needs to work with Buffers directly, it's using internal APIs. That is, I suspect we need to make different revisions to trax so that it's no longer using internal APIs.\n- jakevdp commented on 2020-09-09T20:59:00Z: Fair enough. Perhaps we should provide `jax.api.multi_device_put` that more or less does what the trax function does?\n- jakevdp commented on 2020-09-09T22:39:02Z: Looks like this will be accomplished by @skye's work on a `replicate` function.\n",

There seems to be some convergence issues when dealing with float32. I'm happy to rework whatever is necessary if you have some pointers to papers or pseudocode I could follow.\n- alewis commented on 2020-08-19T17:56:09Z: We have just recently completed a Jax GMRES implementation in https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork, if you guys would like to synchronize. It should be a bit more efficient than this one because it builds the QR decomposition iteratively along with the Krylov space, instead of in one shot at the end; this allows it to terminate early when necessary. We didn't write it with differentiability in mind, however.\n- gehring commented on 2020-08-19T18:06:44Z: Awesome! I'd like to get some confirmation from the JAX devs that they are still interested in adding GMRES before spending more time on this, but if they are, I'm happy to bring in TensorNetwork's iterative QR decomposition and see how it does. As for differentiability, that shouldn't be an issue since we define the differentiation rules using the implicit function theorem, e.g., `jax.lax.custom_linear_solve`.\r\n\r\n@alewis How is the numerical stability when using float32? I've been having issues getting my implementation working reliably in float32 and I'm curious to hear if the implementation in TensorNetwork behaves any better.\n- shoyer commented on 2020-08-19T19:10:29Z: I'm definitely quite supportive of this effort to add GMRES into JAX. Iterative linear solvers are a key building block for scientific computing, and the current CG solver does not suffice due to the restrictions it requires on the types of linear operators.\n- alewis commented on 2020-08-20T16:24:01Z: As far as I can tell ours works fine in float32. @gehring @shoyer should we gvc to coordinate on this at some point?\n- alewis commented on 2020-08-20T16:27:11Z: The implementation in question is in https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork/pull/767 if you'd like to take a look.

One thing to decide is how much should the implementation favor GPU friendly features over CPU friendly features.

For instance, @shoyer found some significant speed ups going from modified Gram-Schmidt to classical Gram-Schmidt (which is what is used in this PR currently) since it can get away with fewer more vectorized operations.\r\n\r\nGiven the use-cases for JAX, I would default to accelerator friendly implementations. But I'm also happy to have multiple implementations.\n- alewis commented on 2020-08-20T18:46:19Z: Our PR uses modified (we call it 'stabilized') Gram-Schmidt. That being said, in realistic use-cases the operations upon the Krylov subspace are a small expense relative to the cost of the matvec evaluation, since this subspace will normally have much smaller dimension than the linear operator. Therefore in practical situations the CPU vs GPU friendliness reduces to that of the matvec.\n- alewis commented on 2020-08-20T18:48:31Z: One thing that *does* matter a lot is whether or not the matvec is Jitted. Our implementation Jits the matvec once, and then caches the result in a variable declared at the module level; otherwise the matvec gets repeatedly traced every time it is called (i.e. during the Arnoldi iterations). This has a huge performance benefit in TensorNetwork but might not be viable in Jax itself.\r\n\r\n@mganahl @Thenerdstation \n- chaserileyroberts commented on 2020-08-20T19:00:23Z: I think within the jax's library you can assume the function being passed in is already jitted, whereas in TN we can't easily make that assumption.\n- shoyer commented on 2020-08-20T19:09:35Z: Within JAX, I think the only case we really need to worry about for performance is if the _entire_ call to GMRES is jitted.\n- alewis commented on 2020-08-24T16:39:32Z: @gehring Any chance we can chat today (for example)?\n- gehring commented on 2020-08-24T16:45:04Z: @alewis Sure!

My understanding of the analogous NumPy case is that it'd still raise an error if too many indices are given for the rank of the operand, as in errors `np.zeros(())[2:2]`.\r\n\r\nHow about we check that the lengths of `start_indices` and `slice_sizes` are both zero, return operand if they are, and error otherwise?\n- j-towns commented on 2020-07-28T14:45:10Z: >How about we check that the lengths of start_indices and slice_sizes are both zero, return operand if they are, and error otherwise?\r\n\r\nI think `_dynamic_slice_indices` (called just above the lines inserted by this PR) already does that check.\r\nhttps://github.com/google/jax/blob/7506a3e5f0137f48415def878bea71c5977dfbd0/jax/lax/lax.py#L5732-L5735\n- j-towns commented on 2020-07-28T14:46:36Z: Well, it checks the length of start_indices, although doesn't check the length of slice_sizes.

It might be reasonable for a user to expect that calling `lax.dynamic_slice` would result in the primitive being called, even in trivial cases. I might try a bit harder to fix the batching rule that is actually causing this issue rather than trying to avoid it.\n",

So yes, we could still link to the notebook from the docs and have a rendered version of it outside of colab, but it wouldn't be dynamically generated by running the notebook anymore. The downside is we won't automatically trigger an error if we make code changes that break the notebook somehow, or even if we don't introduce an error, the saved notebook output could become out-of-date until we manually regenerate it.\r\n\r\nI don't think there are any immediate plans for a `pmap` notebook beyond the pmap cookbook at https://github.com/google/jax/tree/master/cloud_tpu_colabs.\n- 8bitmp3 commented on 2020-06-22T23:10:49Z: @skye I can set the default Colab notebook accelerator to GPU and move the extra TPU settings cell down to the `vmap` section (you can optionally run it).

Another JAX notebook here had a similar issue that I spotted recently and fixed by attaching the hyperlinks to plain words (see https://github.com/google/jax/pull/3502/commits/86fcc77710a9cae27d9caa536709b09a8c7efce4 and https://github.com/google/jax/pull/3501/commits/f351da772435cdd553ecc02921383aef66b2001f)\r\n\r\nIn the Quickstart, I use the following format for functions and methods that have API doc links:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[pmap()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will look like plain text with round brackets: e.g. [ohFunctionMyFunction()](www.google.com) \u2014 notice the lack of back ticks. They causes the original issues (see below).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they're blue and not red.\r\n\r\n_More background:_\r\n\r\nFor external links, Sphinx follows this rule, which already uses back ticks:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is the preferred way in RTD/Sphinx:\r\n\r\n`pmap <https://jax.readthedocs.io/...>`_\r\n```\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this clashes with standard Markdown, which Sphinx supports, just not fully:\r\n\r\n```Markdown\r\n\r\nThis is normal Markdown outside of RTD/Sphinx:\r\n\r\n[`pmap`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(See: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#external-links)\r\n\r\nSo, adding more back ticks around the name of functions that we want to link the API docs to only breaks the sequence/links/everything else.\r\n\r\nFor everything else that doesn't require external links, we leave them as before: `jax.random`, `vmap`, `@jit` (vs @[jit]()), etc.\r\n\n- skye commented on 2020-06-24T19:34:27Z: I like the explicit instructions on how to enable the TPU code! It has the added benefit of teaching new users how to use Cloud TPU colabs :) However, I still think it'd be better to manually generate the notebook so we can have actual code cells + output in the pmap section, instead of requiring users to copy/paste.

Instead of using the Sphinx site generator, you can use MkDocs and an MkDocs Jupyter plugin that doesn't require executing notebooks.\r\n\r\n> Blah, this breaks RTD because it can't run the notebook without a Cloud TPU :( I think this means we have to choose between pmap examples (requires multiple devices --> Cloud TPU) and automated testing/generation of the Quickstart notebook via RTD.\r\n\r\n> RTD can only execute using a CPU. So we can't use pmap on it.\r\n\r\nThe current JAX site generator is Sphinx that uses on reStructured text. Like Sphinx, [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) is also [recommended](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html) by ReadTheDocs. Unlike Sphinx though, it uses Markdown. \r\n\r\nFor Jupyter notebooks, there's a plugin that allows to not only render `.ipynb` files, but also view them without having to pre-run them (you simply state `execute: False` in a YAML).\r\n\r\nBelow is a screenshot from a simple docs site I built.

You configure plugins and extensions in a YAML file. There's a fast search bar and the theme I used is free (it's called Material). There're options to enable text and code highlights and all the other modern bells and whistles within that Material Theme. For example, I added a plugin to show the date of the last commit at the end of each page to easily identify outdated docs.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the search is fast\u2014it shows the results as you type:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19637339/86520299-90816080-be3a-11ea-858b-308170226590.png\">\r\n\r\n\n- 8bitmp3 commented on 2020-07-05T18:19:02Z: Fyi, It's possible to use MkDocs instead of Sphinx and keep the ReadTheDocs theme (it comes pre-loaded and you set it as `theme: name: readthedocs`.\r\n\r\nBelow is another example with the blue color scheme in the `material` theme:\r\n\r\n> The current JAX site generator is Sphinx that uses on reStructured text.

The problem is, it removes support for codepaths that are likely employed by many users (passing lists to jax functions), and so will almost certainly introduce breakages into user code.\r\n\r\nFor any change like this, we should be displaying a deprecation warning for a few releases: that is, if a user is passing input that currently works and will not work after this change, it should not break immediately, but rather raise a `FutureWarning` with instructions about how to fix the issue. Then, once that warning has been present for a few release cycles, we can make the breaking change.\n- joaogui1 commented on 2020-06-08T19:46:19Z: Great idea Jake, this would be quite disruptive to codebases as it stands indeed, I opened a PR with the warning\n- btanner commented on 2020-06-29T20:47:34Z: Hey folks.

If this is really what you want, you can always do it explicitly with something like `jnp.sum(jnp.asarray(tup))`. But if your tuples are small, the overhead of converting them to device arrays before summing is probably not what you want, and if your tuples are large enough that it is what you want, the overhead of constructing them as Python tuples (versus, say, native jax array operations) is probably not what you want.\n- shoyer commented on 2020-06-29T21:05:33Z: > Hi @btanner - we are indeed moving to a world where tuples & lists will not be silently converted to device arrays by jax functions.

I am interested in automatic differentiation of sparse eigensolvers, but new to JAX -- did you already have something in mind about this? My only point of reference is this recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04121) where they reduce computing the adjoint to solving a low-rank linear problem. Maybe your new CG implementation could be used to that end?\n- shoyer commented on 2020-05-21T20:43:00Z: Indeed, if the eigenvalues are unique, you can calculate eigenvalue/eigenvector derivatives in a straightforward fashion. That paper appears to have rediscovered a very old method for efficiently calculated eigenvector derivatives when not all eigenvectors are known, e.g., see this 1976 paper: https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.7211\r\n\r\nThere's actually a rather large literature on this problem from the field of computational mechanics. There are some other formulations that are supposed to be more numerically stable, e.g., so you don't need to solve a non-full rank system of linear equations: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cnm.895. I suspect the resulting linear equations are not necessarily positive, so we would more sophisticated iterative solvers such as (L)GMRES.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is how to define derivatives in the case of degenerate eigenvalues. In that case the eigenvalue problem necessarily isn't a well defined function, so calculating derivatives is quite challenging (maybe even impossible in reverse mode). But we probably don't need to worry this for a first-pass solution.\n- jakevdp commented on 2023-11-03T22:00:30Z: This has become stale - I'm going to close.

My understanding of `linearize` is that it's passing constant tracers into the function meaning that the formal arguments should never be used anywhere in the body of the function (you just inline the constant values instead), but this is not true when an `xla_call` is generated. Do you have any pointers for why that is? It seems morally wrong to me to even try to use those dummy arguments anywhere, as they will always be supplied with units...\n",

The code is really clean too.\r\n\r\nWe debated this a bit in our team chat room and came to the conclusion that we don't think supporting fixed-parameter jax.scipy.stats distributions would be worth the additional implementation complexity. To break that down a bit:\r\n1. The `FrozenDistribution` / `Freezer` implementation is very slick, but that slickness also entails some implementation complexity, e.g. in the form of indirection. Implementation complexity impacts the core team's ability to maintain and revise the code, so to merge something into JAX core any added complexity has to be weighed against the upside it brings.\r\n2. The upside can be hard to estimate, but we usually consider things like (a) how many users have requested a feature (or how much we've used it ourselves in our own numpy/scipy programming) and (b) what alternatives there are. In this case, I don't think we've received many requests for supporting this functionality (other than from you and @jacobjinkelly in #2735, of course!). Moreover, it seems like one can use `functools.partial` to achieve a similar (but not identical) effect of specializing pdfs and samplers on parameter values. (For those who prefer functional programming style over object-oriented programming styles, the alternative of using `functools.partial` might even be preferable.) There were other potential features discussed in #2735 but my understanding is those are speculative for now.  For those reasons the upside currently seems niche, at least given our understanding of our current userbase.\r\n3. There's a substantial ongoing effort to build [TFP](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) on JAX, and to some extent that'd offer a general alternative to `jax.scipy.stats`. Since we have limited developer bandwidth, we're not focusing our development efforts on building out `jax.scipy.stats` features substantially (e.g. with OOP distributions with the potential features discussed in #2735) in large part because of those existing alternative efforts.\r\n\r\nFor those reasons, I don't think it makes sense to merge this in to JAX core at this time.\r\n\r\nHowever, that's not to say that you (and perhaps @jacobjinkelly) shouldn't use this yourselves! This could be a nice layer on top of `jax.scipy.stats` that you keep in its own repo. If the factors that go into the above reasoning change then we might want to consider upstreaming it into JAX core at some point in the future. But right now this doesn't fit into JAX core.\r\n\r\nAgain, I want to underscore how nice this work is. Open source contributions are wonderful, and we really appreciate them.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\n- ziyadedher commented on 2020-05-09T13:44:29Z: The points totally make sense @mattjj, thanks for checking this out! I agree that it is a bit of stretch to include this in JAX core, especially now with the points you brought up.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, is there a public issue tracking the TFP implementation? Better/more flexible distribution support is something I would really love to see in JAX!\n",

Therefore I still suggest to add the signature transfer line, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about it...\r\n\r\n2) The code currently (prior to this PR) does not use `functools.wraps` potentially because it is designed to mutate an existing object, see the call here: https://github.com/google/jax/blob/28e802c6f15d7ed87fee9bee6270137423b9967c/jax/api.py#L1428\r\n\r\n3) I've also made the `util.partial` have the correct signature as well through inspections.

Ideally, it would point at the exact `pmap` line that failed, but I'm not sure how.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n```\r\njax.pmap(f)(jnp.ones((8, 100)), 10)\r\n                                ^\r\nValueError: Argument #2 is missing a leading axis\r\n```\r\n?\r\n\r\n\n- skye commented on 2020-01-13T21:11:36Z: I think you need to plumb the argument indices through into `shard_args` here: https://github.com/google/jax/blob/master/jax/interpreters/pxla.py#L456 (i.e. map over `enumerate(avals)` instead of `avals`, and then plumb the index through to `shard_args` and the underlying handlers). That should let you specify the argument index in the error message, and the stack trace will contain the failing pmap line, which is pretty close!\n- hawkinsp commented on 2020-07-14T19:14:25Z: I believe the underlying issue is fixed (see the linked issue.)\n",

Can you say a bit more about what problem the wider use of `asanyarray` solves? Is there a concrete example of why it is preferable?\n- tomhennigan commented on 2019-12-18T22:10:06Z: So originally I just wanted to add `jnp.asanyarray` since it was missing.\r\n\r\nApologies for the very lacking PR message on the other change.\r\n\r\nThe main difference in my mind is that `jnp.asarray(a)` **always** returns a `DeviceArray` in JAX (compatible with numpy), while `asanyarray(a)` will pass through compatible `ndarray` subclasses (e.g. `onp.ndarray`, `ShardedDeviceArray`). I figured that in all of the replaced usages we just wanted a thing that implemented the `ndarray` API rather than specifically a `DeviceArray` so `asanyarray` was the right choice.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's actually important to do this for performance (since we likely just copy subclasses later in these functions so I am probably not saving a copy). I would be happy to split this into two PRs (adding the new API in one change and following up if replacing `asarray` with `asanyarray` is actually important performance wise in some specific case) if you would prefer.\n- shoyer commented on 2019-12-18T22:19:42Z: It seems to me that `jnp.asarray()` should also probably pass through `ShardedDeviceArray` objects. In which case I would guess `asanyarray` could simply be an alias to `asarray`.\r\n\r\nI am hesitant to introduce different semantics between `asarray()` and `asanyarray()`. At least in NumPy, this function is there to support subclassing, but supporting external subclassing of JAX arrays feels like a dark path to go down...\n- tomhennigan commented on 2019-12-19T07:25:58Z: I agree that supporting user subclassing of JAX arrays is not a good idea today. I also think `asarray(a: ShardedDeviceArray) -> ShardedDeviceArray` is probably the correct behavior (e.g. asarray should pass through \"builtin\" array types). I'll drop this PR and follow up with that change instead (we can debate the details of that FR on there).\r\n\r\nI don't think we should alias `asanyarray = asarray` since this sends a signal that users can expect subclassing to work (which we are not promising).\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!\n",

What if we just exposed a `length` argument to `scan` (so that it didn't require any extensive inputs)?\n- shoyer commented on 2019-11-16T20:06:53Z: > What if we just exposed a `length` argument to `scan` (so that it didn't require any extensive inputs)?\r\n\r\nThat would do it, though it's not entirely clear to me what the signature of scanned function should be in that case.\r\n\r\nI guess the two choices are either:\r\n```python\r\ndef scan(f, init, length):\r\n  carry = init\r\n  ys = []\r\n  for i in range(length):\r\n    carry, y = f(carry, i)\r\n    ys.append(y)\r\n  return carry, np.stack(ys)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```python\r\ndef scan(f, init, length):\r\n  carry = init\r\n  ys = []\r\n  for _ in range(length):\r\n    carry, y = f(carry)\r\n    ys.append(y)\r\n  return carry, np.stack(ys)\r\n```\r\nThe later seems perhaps a little cleaner (what if you don't need the iteration counter?) but now the type  signature looks different, i..e., `(c -> (c, b)) -> c -> (c, [b])`.\n- mattjj commented on 2019-11-16T20:55:13Z: I was thinking of keeping the signature the same, but exposing the `length` parameter of the primitive. Then there could be zero or more scanned (i.e. extensive) inputs just like there can already be zero or more scanned outputs; it would be an error if `length` is provided and it disagrees with the leading axis length of a scanned input. (Currently there can be zero or more scanned outputs, but there must be at least one scanned input, just because that's currently the only way to get the `length`.)\r\n\r\nConcretely:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef scan(f, init, xs, length=None):\r\n  length = length if length is not None else get_axis_length(xs)\r\n  carry = init\r\n  ys = []\r\n  for i in range(length):\r\n    x = get_slice(xs, i)\r\n    carry, y = f(carry, x)\r\n    ys.append(y)\r\n  return carry, np.stack(ys)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `get_axis_length` and `get_slice` handle the case where `xs` is an empty container (like a None).\r\n\r\n(EDIT: I didn't write the logic for raising an error when `length` is provided and disagrees with `get_axis_length(xs)`, but hopefully you  get what I mean!)\n- shoyer commented on 2019-11-16T23:43:24Z: > I was thinking of keeping the signature the same, but exposing the `length` parameter of the primitive.

In that case, let me suggest the following update to the pseudocode / pure-Python version of `scan`:\r\n```python\r\ndef scan(f, init, xs=None, length=None):\r\n  if xs is None:\r\n    xs = [None] * length\r\n  carry = init\r\n  ys = []\r\n  for x in xs:\r\n    carry, y = f(carry, x)\r\n    ys.append(y)\r\n  return carry, np.stack(ys)\r\n```\n- mattjj commented on 2020-01-07T07:12:29Z: We've had some better ideas here!

Both the random key and the parameter are tagged:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef parameter(shape, init, name):\r\n    key = lax.tag(PRNGKey(0), f'rng_{name}')\r\n    return lax.tag(init(key, shape), name)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef Dense(out_dim, kernel_init=glorot(), bias_init=randn()):\r\n    def dense(inputs):\r\n        kernel = parameter((inputs.shape[-1], out_dim), kernel_init, 'kernel')\r\n        bias = parameter((out_dim,), bias_init, 'bias')\r\n        return np.dot(inputs, kernel) + bias\r\n\r\n    return dense\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should allow to extract `init_parameters` and `apply` functions just using `collect`/`inject` from https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1660:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@curry\r\ndef init_parameters_fun(fun, rng, *example_inputs):\r\n    is_rng_name = lambda name: name.startswith('rng_')\r\n    is_parameter_name = lambda name: not is_rng_name(name)\r\n\r\n    def inject_all_rngs(fun, rng_names, rng):\r\n        rng_dict = {}\r\n\r\n        for name in rng_names:\r\n            rng_, rng = random.split(rng)\r\n            rng_dict[name] = rng_\r\n\r\n        return inject(fun, rng_dict)\r\n\r\n    _, tagged_dict = collect(fun)(*example_inputs)\r\n    names = tagged_dict.keys()\r\n    rng_names = list(filter(is_rng_name, names))\r\n    parameter_names = list(filter(is_parameter_name, names))\r\n\r\n    rng_injected_fun = inject_all_rngs(fun, rng_names, rng)\r\n    _, tagged_dict = collect(rng_injected_fun)(rng, *example_inputs)\r\n    return {tagged_dict[p] for p in parameter_names}\r\n\r\n\r\n@curry\r\ndef apply_fun(fun, parameters, *example_inputs):\r\n    return inject(fun, parameters)(*example_inputs)\r\n\r\n\r\ndense = Dense(3)\r\nparameters = init_parameters_fun(dense)(PRNGKey(0), np.zeros(1, 3))\r\noutputs = apply_fun(dense)(parameters, np.zeros(1, 3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't understand your explanation for `lax.push_tag` / metadata stacks / namespaces in https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1660 well enough to predict how much this helps for supporting nested parametrized functions / parameter structure (as currently implemented in JAXnet). Could you provide an example? I tried to understand it via your tests, but I am confused about [`test_collect_nested`](https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1660/files#diff-06ab2b0737d4f2ec271cadcee9ac2ff7R59) / [`test_inject_nested`](https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1660/files#diff-06ab2b0737d4f2ec271cadcee9ac2ff7R98): How can the string `\"y\"` be used as a JAX value?\r\n\r\nRemarkably, this seems to require two `collect` calls in `init_parameters_fun`, with the first one parsing the occurring random key names that are to be injected. I wonder whether there is a way to combine this call with the following `inject` call, i. e. providing a version of `inject` that injects into a subset of all tags where the name fulfills a specified property, and the injected values are specified via a callback.\n- gehring commented on 2019-11-13T17:49:51Z: @JuliusKunze The heavy dependence on naming is giving me `tf.variable_scope` flashbacks. Any thoughts on how the same pitfalls that made variable scopes clunky can be avoided here? Hopefully this wouldn't require the same kind of heavy machinery used by Sonnet v1 for scope tracking.\n- juliuskunze commented on 2019-11-13T19:46:37Z: @gehring Very much agree, a horrible aspect of TF1 variable management is that parameter sharing was controlled via names and the resulting intransparent cross-dependencies. Under the assumption that tags with the same (path) name will cause an error in the tagging transformation (https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1660), this will not be an issue. An open question is then how else parameter sharing could be implemented only using tagging transformations. It's not yet clear to me how this could work without nested tracing / object identity ([like in JAXnet](https://github.com/JuliusKunze/jaxnet/blob/master/API.md#parameter-sharing)).\r\n\r\nThe `startswith('rng_')` part is obviously super unreliable (just used it to showcase the idea), but this could potentially be made robust with more advanced metadata infrastructure announced in https://github.com/google/jax/pull/1660 (waiting for more details here).\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-11-14T05:18:26Z: > I don't understand your explanation for lax.push_tag / metadata stacks / namespaces in #1660 well enough to predict how much this helps for supporting nested parametrized functions / parameter structure (as currently implemented in JAXnet). Could you provide an example?\r\n\r\nFirst, an example which conflates RNG keys and parameter scopes (but can still express weight sharing):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@curry\r\ndef Dense(features_out, key, x):\r\n  features_in = x.shape[-1]\r\n  W = initializers.normal()(random.fold_in(key, \"W\"), (features_in, features_out))\r\n  b = initializers.normal()(random.fold_in(key, \"b\"), (features_out,))\r\n  return np.dot(x, W) + b\r\n\r\n@curry\r\ndef Serial(layers, x):\r\n  for layer in layers:\r\n    x = layer(x)\r\n  return x\r\n\r\ndef my_net(key, x):\r\n  layer_1 = Dense(2, random.fold_in(key, \"dense_1\"))\r\n  layer_2 = Dense(x.shape[0], random.fold_in(key, \"dense_2\"))\r\n  net = Serial([layer_1, layer_2, layer_1])\r\n  return net(x)\r\n\r\nx = np.ones(3)\r\ninit_key = random.PRNGKey(0)\r\nparams = collect(my_net)(init_key, x)\r\napply_key = random.PRNGKey(0)\r\ny = inject(my_net, params)(apply_key, x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is cute, but there's one slightly magical thing going on: the argument `key` is playing multiple roles. At initialization time, it's carrying the value of the initialization key. At application time, it's carrying the value of a runtime PRNG key (e.g. for dropout; unused here). And at both times, it's carrying scope/tag metadata through its data dependency.\r\n\r\nYou can also split out the RNG and scope roles:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@curry\r\ndef Dense(features_out, key, scope, x):\r\n  features_in = x.shape[-1]\r\n  W_key, b_key = random.split(key)\r\n  W = lax.tag(random.normal(W_key, (features_in, features_out)), \"W\", scope)\r\n  b = lax.tag(random.normal(b_key, (features_out,)), \"b\", scope)\r\n  return np.dot(x, W) + b\r\n\r\n@curry\r\ndef Serial(layers, x):\r\n  for layer in layers:\r\n    x = layer(x)\r\n  return x\r\n\r\ndef my_net(key, scope, x):\r\n  key_1, key_2 = random.split(key)\r\n  layer_1 = Dense(2, key_1, lax.push_tag(scope, \"dense_1\"))\r\n  layer_2 = Dense(x.shape[0], key_2, lax.push_tag(scope, \"dense_2\"))\r\n  net = Serial([layer_1, layer_2, layer_1])\r\n  return net(x)\r\n\r\nx = np.ones(3)\r\ninit_key = random.PRNGKey(0)\r\nscope = 0. # can be any JAX value at all; we only use it for metadata\r\nparams = collect(my_net)(init_key, scope, x)\r\napply_key = random.PRNGKey(0)\r\ny = inject(my_net, params)(apply_key, scope, x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut you can see why it might be convenient to use the same argument for both (it's related to the question in a framework like Sonnet of whether you want to maintain a single \"module stack\" or separate stacks for parameters, submodules, etc.).\r\n\r\nIs that helpful? Note that in this scheme parameter sharing _is_ driven by names, but (one way to see it is that) it's driven specifically by names folded into RNG keys, and those names are going to be mostly function-local (because of the hierarchy). While there are lots of benefits of using Python object identity to drive parameter sharing instead, it's a tricky choice in JAX because tracers can never depend on Python object identity behavior\u2014it's completely lost under `jit`! This is essentially because depending on Python object identity means breaking [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency), since two modules can have the same _value_ but may or may not have the same identity.\n- juliuskunze commented on 2019-11-14T08:37:42Z: @jekbradbury Very helpful, thank you.\r\n\r\nWhat's the behavior of\r\n```python\r\ntest = lambda: lax.tag(1, \"a\") + lax.tag(2, \"a\")\r\nprint(collect(test)())\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `print(inject(test, {\"a\": 1})())` going to be?\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-11-14T16:02:29Z: That function has no data dependence on inputs, so none of the JAX tracers will see what happens in it. We could create a dynamically scoped tracer instead, but its interaction with other transformations would be very hard, maybe impossible, to get right.\n- juliuskunze commented on 2019-11-14T17:09:01Z: @jekbradbury I see. What about\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntest = lambda x: lax.tag(x + 1, \"a\") + lax.tag(x + 2, \"a\")\r\nprint(collect(test)(0))\r\nprint(inject(test, {\"a\": 1})(0))\r\n```\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-11-17T00:35:27Z: I'm not sure what that should do. I can see arguments for an error (the current behavior) or for the second tagged value to be replaced by the value yielded in the first one (this might make it easier to build libraries like Sonnet/jaxnet on top of tagging).\r\n\r\nBut I'm leaning towards an error because of examples like this one: here, the two values don't have a data dependency on each other, so the mutual order in which they're tagged isn't well-defined (due to toposorting and our assumption of no side effects, `partial_eval` might reorder such independent primitive operations relative to the order they were executed in the Python interpreter).\n- juliuskunze commented on 2019-11-26T13:33:26Z: @jekbradbury +1 for a loud error. Parameter sharing should not require specifying multiple redundant (and therefore possibly inconsistent) initialization functions in the first place.\r\n\r\nWill any object be usable as metadata for `lax.push_tag` (i. e. not just strings)? \r\n\r\nRegarding: \"While there are lots of benefits of using Python object identity to drive parameter sharing instead, it's a tricky choice in JAX because tracers can never depend on Python object identity behavior\u2014it's completely lost under jit!\" JAXnet allows both by using object identity of ([`parametrized`](https://github.com/JuliusKunze/jaxnet/blob/master/jaxnet/core.py#L23)) _primitives_ for parameter sharing, which is [not lost](https://github.com/JuliusKunze/jaxnet/blob/master/tests/test_core.py#L199) under transformations like `jit`.\r\n\n",

That is, it's not just a different implementation of `log`, but rather it computes a different function.\r\n\r\nI looked for some clues in the TF and XLA repos, and I found that [TensorFlow computes its `reduce_logsumexp` the same way JAX already does](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/612e0969d65e8615f1ef0610733edb49ba1a15a4/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py#L2446-L2462) and does not use `log1p`. My read of [the SciPy `logsumexp` code](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/13ba7a563518dda6619f3e8a832947f11fba09b4/scipy/special/_logsumexp.py#L94-L129) also suggests they're doing it the same way. That actually makes me think there might not be something better to do here...\r\n\r\nI think this is my mistake: I opened #1205 guessing that there was some better way to implement `logsumexp`, but after checking TF and other implementations, my thinking has changed. I'm going to close #1205 (and this PR as well) but if we eventually come up with a better algorithm, let's reopen #1205 and make a new PR for it.\r\n\r\nSorry for leading you down the wrong path with my guess!

        "Pull Request 1133 titled 'add a helper class for a sequence of PRNG keys' was created by inoryy (User). The PR is in closed state. The PR contains N/A commits, with 0 additions and 0 deletions across 0 files. \n\nBody: No description available\n\nComments:\n- mattjj commented on 2019-08-07T14:23:38Z: Unfortunately this kind of wrapper relies on Python side effects for correct behavior (namely the line `self._key, subkey = split(self._key)`), and while there are several cases in which this functions correctly, it won't always.\r\n\r\nThe case to keep in mind is `jit` boundaries. JAX's guarantee is that adding or removing `jit` on a pure (non-side-effecting) function will leave the values computed unchanged (up to floating point details) and only change how the function is executed. But when we have side-effects that guarantee can fail.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import print_function\r\nfrom jax.random import PRNGKey, split\r\n\r\nclass PRNGKeySequence(object):\r\n  \"\"\"A simple wrapper class for the PRNG split functionality.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n  def __init__(self, key=None):\r\n    if key is None or not is_prng_key(key):\r\n      key = PRNGKey(0)\r\n    self._key = key\r\n\r\n  def next_key(self):\r\n    \"\"\"Splits the current key into two, returning one and storing the other.\r\n\r\n    Returns:\r\n      A PRNG key obtained by splitting an internal key.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    self._key, subkey = split(self._key)\r\n    return subkey\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom jax import jit\r\nfrom jax.random import normal\r\n\r\nkey_seq = PRNGKeySequence()\r\n\r\ndef f(x):\r\n  key = key_seq.next_key()\r\n  return normal(key, ()) * x\r\nprint(f(2), f(2))  # different! (whp)\r\n\r\ng = jit(f)  # should behave just like `f`...\r\nprint(g(2), g(2))  # same! (wp 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese side-effect bookkeeping wrappers are useful when you use them only entirely inside a `jit` context (analogous to how we use [in-place updates](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/d6bd59d71684ed51fb7d3bcdb5359279bd5d218c/jax/experimental/lapax.py#L54) on the [`LapaxMatrix` in jax.experimental.lapax](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/d6bd59d71684ed51fb7d3bcdb5359279bd5d218c/jax/experimental/lapax.py#L164)), or only entirely outside a `jit` context. But techniques that violate functional purity break the requirements of `jit` and so break the behavioral correspondence between jitted and un-jitted code. For those reasons we want to keep these potential foot-guns out of JAX proper, though of course users might find them helpful (as long as they're careful when using them!).\r\n\r\nDo you buy that argument? What do you think?\n- inoryy commented on 2019-08-07T15:22:51Z: Thanks for the detailed explanation! I was typically creating it from inside the function call so this issue had never even occurred to me. I'm fully on-board with keeping foot-guns (love the name) out of JAX core.\r\n\r\nDo you think there's a way to achieve something similar without side-effects? If not, feel free to close the PR.\n- mattjj commented on 2019-08-07T16:29:39Z: > Do you think there's a way to achieve something similar without side-effects?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we haven't been able to come up with any good ideas on that front. (There are extremely heavyweight solutions one can imagine, adding lots of global state and side-effects to JAX itself, but that way lies madness and wouldn't fit with our design principles.)\r\n\r\nThis seems to be an instance of a general pattern we've found: explicit management of state makes composable function transformations easy (in this case, staging out code to XLA), and even simple side-effects break that. Our interest in functional programming is entirely for practical reasons like these.\r\n\r\nIt's worth continuing to think about how to improve the ergonomics of PRNGs (and the rest of the system), especially where side-effecting semantics seem to be so convenient. One thing we think we can do is provide better guardrails for errors like in my example: we're working on PRNG key reuse checking (i.e. \"linearity\" checking) which would catch the bug caused by using this side-effecting pattern across `jit` boundaries. (Another thing we can improve is documentation around design constraints like these!)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, though, I think it's best to close this issue. Thanks for bringing it up!\n",

I think either would work here.\n- mattjj commented on 2019-07-09T15:37:24Z: Good question. I just remembered that this works:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(jit(lambda x: x)(None))\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause [we register None as a pytree](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/76eda746bd28256fdba1b96036e8faa49088feea/jax/tree_util.py#L238). We could do the same with Ellipsis, adding this to tree_util.py (and also a rule for `slice` objects):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nregister_pytree_node(type(Ellipsis), lambda z: ((), None), lambda _, xs: Ellipsis)\r\nregister_pytree_node(slice,\r\n                     lambda s: ((s.start, s.stop, s.step), None),\r\n                     lambda _, xs: slice(*xs))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, that slice solution didn't pass our tests on your branch because of how we use the `slice.indices` method. This implementation does pass all tests on your branch, but assumes there aren't Tracers in the slice fields:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nregister_pytree_node(slice,\r\n                     lambda s: ((), (s.start, s.stop, s.step)),\r\n                     lambda meta, _: slice(*meta))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we can get the first solution for `slice` working, we'd be in business! Gotta look at it more.\n- mattjj commented on 2019-07-09T15:52:49Z: Ah the issue was that these added `@jit`s were then abstracting the contents of slices to the Shaped level, which would mean static slice indices were turned into dynamic slice indices. If we replace the use of `@jit` you added with `@partial(jit, static_argnums=(1,))` that avoids abstracting the indices and everything works!\r\n\r\nActually, I think it'd be better just to add a `@partial(jit, static_argnums=(1, 3))` decoration to `_scatter_update` rather than the wrapper functions.\r\n\r\nThis might be slightly more fine-grained caching than we need: we might be able to get more compilation cache hits if we just don't raise the abstraction level of (the contents of) `slice` instances. But that seems like more trouble than it's worth, since the point here is just to get these things under a `jit`.\r\n\r\n@shoyer wdyt?\r\n\r\n@dougalm any problem with registering `ellipsis` and `slice` as pytrees, like we do `NoneType`?\n- mattjj commented on 2019-07-09T15:54:32Z: I pushed 8c72e2f to a branch so you can take a look at the changes I proposed above.\n- shoyer commented on 2019-08-09T16:53:50Z: @mattjj It looks like your branch handles this better than what I had here, so let's just abandon this PR in favor of that.

I'm quite interested in exploring this approach.  I've achieved similar through crazy hacks via closures at the moment, but I like the idea of using jax's tracing engine for this problem.\n- jekbradbury commented on 2019-02-26T01:46:59Z: I could be missing something, but I think this gets at the distinction I brought up recently in the context of JAX neural net libraries between pointiness in what we might call \"layer builders,\" pointiness in \"layer instances,\" and pointiness in \"symbolic tensors.\"\r\n\r\nLike the Keras functional API, `pointy_to_stax_layer` provides pointiness in symbolic tensors that's absent from plain stax. If we assume that `+` is overloaded to create a `stax.parallel` and a `stax.sum`, something like this should work for a basic example of a non-linear topology:\r\n```python\r\ndef residual_dense(x):\r\n  return x + stax.Dense(out_dim=4)(x)\r\ninit_fn, apply_fn = pointy_to_stax_layer(residual_conv)\r\n```\r\nHere `x` is essentially a symbolic tensor: `pointy_to_stax_layer` will trace it once and build a stax AST, and further calls (including at runtime or in the `jit` tracer) will call the `+` inside `stax.sum`, not the one in `residual_conv`. This kind of pointiness is the AST-level equivalent of creating a stax layer with a custom `apply_fn` (where symbolic tensors are already pointy).\r\n\r\nIt also has pointiness in uninitialized layer constructor objects that I'm calling layer builders (but here it's not materially different from original stax):\r\n```python\r\n# with `pointy_to_stax_layer`:\r\ndef double_dense(x):\r\n  dense = stax.Dense(out_dim=4)\r\n  return dense(dense(x))\r\ninit_fn, apply_fn = pointy_to_stax_layer(double_dense)\r\n# with plain stax:\r\ndense = stax.Dense(out_dim=4)\r\ninit_fn, apply_fn = stax.serial(dense, dense)\r\n```\r\nHere `dense` is not an initialized layer but simply a recipe for a layer; in either of the two snippets above the two dense layers will share the same constructor arguments but will be initialized separately (the returned `init_fn` will call the `init_fn` of `dense` twice).\r\n\r\nWhat Anselm is asking for is pointiness in layer objects, which would provide the ability to alias initialized layers (\"share parameters\"/\"tie weights\"). One way to do this is TensorFlow-style `get_variable`, but we'll pretend that never happened :slightly_smiling_face:. Another is a vaguely Lasagne-style API, something approximately like this where the default is pointiness in layer instances, but pointiness in symbolic tensors is available by accessing a layer instance attribute:\r\n```python\r\ndef shared_params_dense(x):\r\n  dense1 = Dense(x, out_dim=4)\r\n  dense2 = Dense(dense1.out, out_dim=4, w=dense1.w)\r\n  return dense2.out\r\n```\r\nAlternatively the default can be pointiness in symbolic tensors while pointiness in layer instances is available if needed:\r\n```python\r\ndef shared_params_dense(x):\r\n  y = Dense(x, out_dim=4)\r\n  dense1 = y.layer\r\n  return Dense(y, out_dim=4, w=dense1.w)\r\n```\r\nAnd yet one more way was introduced in Torch's nngraph library, where pointiness in layer instances and symbolic tensors play parallel roles to pointiness in layer builders and symbolic tensors in this PR:\r\n```python\r\ndef shared_params_dense(x):\r\n  dense = Dense(in_dim=4, out_dim=4) # in_dim is needed because this line actually initializes the layer\r\n  return dense(dense(x))\r\n```\r\nIn kind of a dual of the symbolic tensor situation, this kind of pointiness is the AST-level equivalent of creating a stax layer with a custom `init_fn` (where layer/parameter instances are already pointy):\r\n```python\r\ndef double_with_shared_params(layer):\r\n  def init_fn():\r\n    layer_init, _ = layer\r\n    layer_instance = layer_init()\r\n    return (layer_instance, layer_instance)\r\n  def apply_fn(x, params):\r\n    _, layer_apply = layer\r\n    l1, l2 = params\r\n    return layer_apply(layer_apply(x, p1), p2)\r\n```\n- j-towns commented on 2019-02-26T09:52:59Z: Nice! That's quite a lot to take in, you've got a lot further than I had thinking about this. I hadn't thought about weight sharing at all, but obviously that's a pretty common requirement.\r\n\r\n> It also has pointiness in uninitialized layer constructor objects that I'm calling layer builders (but here it's not materially different from original stax)\r\n\r\nI'm probably misunderstanding something, are you saying all things which can be implemented in pointy stax (the current implementation in this pr), can be implemented in original stax? I'm not sure that's true, although I haven't thought too hard about it. I couldn't see how to implement the [pixelcnn++ model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2wu9IkzLaA0OrlqEU9Htd-sOsjRrS_Z/view) in original stax.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone's interested, the code for the original pixelcnn++ model is [here](https://github.com/openai/pixel-cnn/blob/master/pixel_cnn_pp/model.py), and my JAX/pointy stax port is [here](https://gist.github.com/j-towns/23acfd9f1b1a2239539917190b7c01be).\n- j-towns commented on 2019-02-28T09:46:56Z: I'm wondering whether pointy stax should maybe become the default way to define a NN. It seems more flexible and user-friendly than using `parallel` and `serial` to me. It's conceptually simpler imo because all it's doing is removing weights from the function definition.\r\n\r\nWe should allow for weight sharing/using the same layer in more than one place, and I think the most straightforward way to do that is to have the layer functions return a layer instance, rather than a layer builder, so you can build an RNN like this:\r\n```python\r\ndef rnn(inputs):\r\n    dense_r = Dense(4)\r\n    recurrent_layer = lambda inputs: Relu(dense_r(inputs))\r\n    for _ in range(sequence_length):\r\n        inputs = recurrent_layer(inputs)\r\n    return inputs\r\n```\r\nThis will mean you have to do more layer instantiations, and in a network with many layers of identical type (but different weights) you'd end up with a little more code, but I think that's a relatively rare use case.\r\n\r\nIt'll be straightforward to implement the above. At the moment parameters are stored in a dictionary that's indexed by equations from the traced jaxpr. I think the only thing to really change is to index the dictionary by the stax layer rather than the jaxpreqn. As a bonus, it should be more straightforward to make the params dict more human readable. I'll have a go at implementing that so we can see what it looks like.\n- levskaya commented on 2019-03-06T06:30:00Z: Hey @j-towns you might want to check out an early version of some pointy name-binding constructs we've introduced at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/trax/stax in slax.py - basically the Share, Bind, and Lambda decorators that enable simple pointiness in stax.  \r\nI really love the idea of figuring out how to do all this natively inside JAX and leveraging the tracing machinery there to find the proper long-term solution to NN code, but the above hacks are pretty simple python tricks for letting stax scale a little further short-term.\n- j-towns commented on 2020-11-03T14:07:26Z: Another uncompromisingly functional, lightweight approach to doing 'implicit data-flow' in JAX is to make functions into pytrees, with a flattener that returns all array constants. This allows you to (for example) take gradients with respect to constants in a function. Very little code is required to do this. You can bootstrap off of the way that JAX already hoists array constants when tracing to a jaxpr.\r\n\r\nDougal did something a bit like this in [one of the Autograd examples](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/commit/92f870), and the [`tree_util.Partial`](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/e9b364748f947cbb86735b9692ad92ed66d7ec95/jax/tree_util.py#L262) wrapper is also related.

In fact, we should probably parameterize `make_jaxpr` by an `abstractify` function, though we could choose a default. It would be useful to be able to ask \"what's this Python function look like for concrete values?\" and \"what's this Python function look like for shaped values?\", where the latter could be an error e.g. if there's Python control flow dependent on values that were abstracted away.\r\n\r\nThat said, I suspect the right default is to leave it as it is, since our main use case for this function so far has been to look at what vmap does.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\n- j-towns commented on 2019-01-21T11:07:51Z: \ud83d\udc4d thanks a lot for the info, will close this.\n"

LMK if you have any thoughts.\n- mattjj commented on 2024-04-19T17:03:22Z: In jit-compilation.md, I think this paragraph might make it sound like `global_list.append` has more of a chance at predictable behavior than it really does:\r\n\r\n> Of course, impure functions can still be written and even run, but JAX gives no guarantees about their behaviour under transformations. However, as a rule of thumb, you can expect (but shouldn\u2019t rely on) the side-effects of a JIT-compiled function to run once (during the first call), and never again, due to JAX\u2019s traced execution model.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that in the example, we'll leak a tracer, and all heck will break loose! \r\n\r\nMaybe we can change it to something like:\r\n\r\nImpure functions are dangerous because under JAX transformations they are likely not to behave as intended; they might fail silently, or produce surprising downstream errors like leaked Tracers. Moreover, JAX often can't detect when side effects are present. (If you want debug printing, use `jax.debug.print` (link to debugging section of tutorial!). To express general side-effects at the cost of performance, see `jax.experimental.io_callback` (link to docs). To check for tracer leaks at the cost of performance, use `with jax.check_tracer_leaks` (link to docs).)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about all those forward pointers but they may be useful. I've liked the other forward pointers in here so far!\n- mattjj commented on 2024-04-19T17:04:32Z: ~In jit-compilation.md, another possible forward-pointer: when we talk about `print`, we can say it's a trace-time print, and if you want a run-time debug print that _does_ appear in the jaxpr, check out `jax.debug.print`.~\r\n\r\nNevermind, that's exactly what is already said in debugging.md. So a forward pointer covers that.\n- mattjj commented on 2024-04-19T17:05:54Z: This list item indentation in jit-compilation.md is a bit off:\r\n<img width=\"816\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/google/jax/assets/1458824/6cd1641a-8fa8-4feb-951c-8a25d8260592\">\r\n\n- mattjj commented on 2024-04-19T17:09:02Z: In jit-compilation.md, I think this section is misleading:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"821\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/google/jax/assets/1458824/77802aa1-3979-4867-b536-d1bc1005e1fe\">\r\n\r\nWe forgot the `block_until-ready` on the second example!\r\n\r\nI think the whole section is misleading, though, because `jit` likely always worth it. It should have lower overhead on each execution, and we have to compile in both cases, just the jit-decorated case compiles one larger program rather than multiple smaller ones.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can just excise the whole section? The message at the end, to jit the largest chunks of your program that you can, is a good one, so maybe we can just keep that last paragraph?\n- mattjj commented on 2024-04-19T17:10:52Z: In automatic-differentiation.md, we write \"automatic differentiation (autodiff)\" twice (once in each of the first two sections). The second time could just say \"autodiff\".\n- jakevdp commented on 2024-04-19T17:47:37Z: > In quickstart.md there's a sentence that says \"For more advanced autodiff operations, you can use jax..jacrev() for reverse-mode vector-Jacobian products, and jax.jacfwd() for forward-mode Jacobian-vector products\"\r\n\r\nIt previously said something like this, but I found it confusing because the sentence mentions `jax.jvp` and `jax.vjp`, then gives an example using `jax.jacfwd` and `jax.jacrev`. I fixed this by changing the functions mentioned in the paragraph.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with switching back, but that re-introduces the strangeness of the example not using the functions mentioned in the test. What do you suggest?\n- jakevdp commented on 2024-04-19T17:56:19Z: I'm going to close this PR, becuase it's about moving camera-ready content to the right place. The volume of content-related comments is telling me it's not actually camera-ready! It will be cleanest to address those separately in-place, and then move the content once it's ready.\n- mattjj commented on 2024-04-19T18:29:48Z: > I'm fine with switching back, but that re-introduces the strangeness of the example not using the functions mentioned in the test. What do you suggest?\r\n\r\nYeah tricky call. Do you think it's okay to use `vmap` here (with a forward pointer), even though we haven't covered it in the tutorial order yet? If so then I'll try inlining simplified (no pytree handling) definitions of `jacfwd` and `jacrev`, so the example looks like `vmap` + `jvp` + `vmap` + `vjp` = `hessian`, and we can take a look at that version. Or if it's a priori obvious that we shouldn't mention `vmap` here, I'm not sure what to do... maybe move it to the `vmap` section and have a forward pointer here?\n- jakevdp commented on 2024-04-19T18:35:38Z: I don't think we should confuse things by adding `vmap`. If you want to mention `jvp` and `vjp`, then the example should use those. Or, if you want to keep the example as-is, maybe one more sentence explaining why it's relevant would be enough.\n",

Wouldn't it be easier to use if we passed the seed for the key generator into the PRNG, and took care of generating the key for the user? Also, couldn't we say that it is a non-stateful PRNG in the docstring?\n- mattjj commented on 2023-03-09T19:46:25Z: Thanks for the idea, but I agree with what Peter wrote. Some additional points:\r\n1. Passing around ints means the program expresses strictly less information than if it were to pass around PRNGKeys instead. Concretely that would defeat several of our ideas for PRNGKey reuse checking (which would check reuse of PRNGKeys but not ints, so the more PRNGKey-typed values in the program the safer we can be).\r\n2. It simultaneously makes the code less abstract and less flexible, since the PRNGKey details aren't abstracted away (and so we can't switch PRNG key generation strategies).\r\n3. If someone wants this convenience layer today, even at the above costs, they can pretty easily just wrap all the functions. But we tend to shy away from baking tradeoff-inducing convenience wrappers into JAX itself.\n- sr5434 commented on 2023-03-09T20:05:56Z: Couldn\u2019t we have the current functions and wrapper functions so that users can choose which function they can use?\n- mattjj commented on 2023-03-09T20:21:31Z: Certainly we could, but we don't bake those convenience wrappers into JAX itself.\n- sr5434 commented on 2023-03-09T20:26:32Z: Oh ok.\n- sr5434 commented on 2023-03-09T20:32:43Z: > Thanks for the idea, but I agree with what Peter wrote.

Also, couldn\u2019t we add an argument to the function call allowing them to switch key generation strategies?\n- froystig commented on 2023-03-10T01:08:43Z: We don't do reuse checks by default, so you could say we \"trust the user\" all the time, but we offer a means of opting into a checker (under development). It's helpful in debugging.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close. Discussion can always continue of course. This is a major breaking change to the public API, and it adds complexity in making the functions in `jax.random` inconsistent with one another, so we'd need a strong case for it.\n- sr5434 commented on 2023-03-10T13:21:37Z: If we have wrappers alongside the original functions for all PRNG algorithms, would it be possible to merge?\n- soraros commented on 2023-03-10T14:07:50Z: > - If someone wants this convenience layer today, even at the above costs, they can pretty easily just wrap all the functions. But we tend to shy away from baking tradeoff-inducing convenience wrappers into JAX itself.\r\n\r\n@sr5434, based on @mattjj's bullet point above, I'd say highly unlikely.\r\nPersonally, I think JAX's random module is very well-designed. Maybe this [tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/05-random-numbers.html) or the [design note](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jep/263-prng.html) can convince you that the `KeyArray` is a better idea than NumPy-style random seed (with all the other benefit JAX provided at least).\r\n\r\nBTW, I suppose this discussion is better continued in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/google/jax/discussions).\n",

Editing the author on the commit alone did not fix the failed cla check, but starting a new branch with the corrected email did.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-13T16:08:30Z: Sorry for the CLA issue \u2013 the problem is that *every* commit in the PR needs to be from a known author with a signed CLA, so adding a second commit with a different author email is not sufficient. Glad you finally figured it out! For future reference, if you need to \"start from scratch\" on a branch, you can do so by force-pushing to the existing branch rather than by opening a new PR.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look at this! I'll review shortly \ud83d\ude00 \n- big-c-note commented on 2022-07-14T04:20:13Z: Thanks for the detailed review and your time @jakevdp . I'm enjoying the project.\r\n\r\nResponded to your points and implemented.\r\n\r\nNo worries on the cla.\r\n\r\nIf you've got any recommendations on issues to work on next, I'd like to either get (a tad) closer to the compiler or implement something that makes use of `grad` within the code base.\r\n\r\nLet me know if any further updates would be nice here\n- big-c-note commented on 2022-07-15T05:47:55Z: Shoot, that cla error does not belong to me - was trying to get all the latest changes in the branch, and I brought in a commit from a-googler who didn't sign a cla.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's close, but I did notice two oddities.\r\n1) `jax.scipy.stats.mode(2, axis=0)` produces `ValueError` for axis out of bounds. `scipy.stats.mode(2, axis=0)` produces a result.\r\n\r\nI'm going to hack on that this weekend and check through a few other edge cases.\r\n\r\n2) Am I using `_wraps` for docstrings appropriately? In an ipython debug session I was running `scipy.stats.mode??` and seeing documentation, but `jax.scipy.stats.mode??` gave me back code. Maybe just strageness with ipython but throwing it out there.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-15T16:00:20Z: It looks like you merged onto the main branch; try rebasing on the main branch instead (we'll have to do this eventually anyway to conform to the single-commit change policy; see https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#single-change-commits-and-pull-requests)\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-15T16:02:10Z: > Am I using _wraps for docstrings appropriately? In an ipython debug session I was running scipy.stats.mode?? and seeing documentation, but jax.scipy.stats.mode?? gave me back code. Maybe just strageness with ipython but throwing it out there.\r\n\r\ndouble question marks in IPython shows source code, while single question marks show the docstring. It sounds like this is working as expected, given that in scipy the docstring literal is in the source code, while in JAX it's included programatically.\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-07-25T17:51:38Z: Any update? You should be able to get your branch in order using something like this\r\n```bash\r\n$ git checkout main\r\n$ git pull upstream main # <-- assuming upstream is the name you used to point to the main jax repo\r\n$ git checkout adds_scipy_stats_mode\r\n$ git rebase main\r\n```\n- jakevdp commented on 2022-10-11T16:14:59Z: Thanks for the work on this \u2013 closing in favor of https://github.com/google/jax/pull/12683\n",

If so, I probably won't have to discuss this with a lawyer ;-)\r\n\r\nI don't speak for Google's lawyers, but yes, my understanding is that the CLA applies only to your contributions, e.g., PRs.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, we don't want to incorporate GPL-licensed code because it would require us to distribute JAX itself under a much more restrictive license than its current license (Apache 2). (Obviously third parties are welcome to plug in GPL code: it's just not something we ourselves want to distribute.)\r\n\r\nTo get this merged, we'd need ducc0's LICENSE information to be explicit about which files are under the BSD license and where the GPL license does not apply, i.e., a clear statement from you as the author in the project's license information that the GPL license doesn't apply to any of the files needed for FFT transformations.\r\n\r\nCurrently it looks like, for example, in ducc0 `fft/fft.h` is marked as BSD-licensed, but some of its dependencies (e.g., in `infra/`) are GPL-licensed and marked as such. We'd need everything in the transitive closure of the FFT library to fall under the more liberal license (e.g.., a BSD license, see https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/licenses/#notice) and for that to be clearly stated. Does that seem possible?\r\n\r\n\n- mreineck commented on 2022-01-25T14:40:35Z: > Currently it looks like, for example, in ducc0 fft/fft.h is marked as BSD-licensed, but some of its dependencies (e.g., in infra/) are GPL-licensed and marked as such.

The documentation generated from these notebooks is not affected by the presence or absence of an ID in cell metadata.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to be able to link persistently to any cell in the Colab view of the notebook, we'll have to add a metadata specification with a cell ID for that particular cell.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think this is the right call is because I think of these notebooks as primarily a source from which our HTML docs are built, and only secondarily as executable documents that can be opened in Colab.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-02-17T00:19:06Z: On second thought I think we should keep the metadata.\n",

This actually isn't a typo though: we set the value of `inputs` to be used on the subsequent loop iteration (by the line above this one). I read it as \"produce the inputs to the next layer.\"\r\n\r\nI really appreciate you looking for and suggesting fixes to typos; it's better to have some false alarms than to miss any detections!\n- chrisfcarroll commented on 2020-08-13T16:23:16Z: \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\n- jakevdp commented on 2020-08-13T16:47:56Z: This is at least the second time someone has flagged this particular line in the README as confusing - perhaps it would be useful to add a comment in the code describing the intent?\n- chrisfcarroll commented on 2020-08-13T17:03:46Z: Then the solution would be to change the variable names `input` & `output` to express the intent, but alas I cannot divine from the snippet what the intent is. Is it something like the below?\r\n\r\nIf so, then simply rename `input` --> `activations` might suffice?\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef predict(params, activations_accumulator):\r\n  for W, b in params:\r\n    layer_activation = jnp.dot(activations_accumulator, W) + b\r\n    activations_accumulator = jnp.tanh(outputs)\r\n  return layer_activation\r\n\r\ndef sum_squared_error(params, activations_accumulator, targets):\r\n  preds = predict(params, activations_accumulator)\r\n  return jnp.sum((preds - targets)**2)\r\n\r\ngradients_fun = jit(grad(sum_squared_error))  # compiled gradient evaluation function\r\nperex_gradients = jit(vmap(gradients_fun, in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))  # fast per-example grads\r\n```\r\n\n- mattjj commented on 2020-08-13T17:16:55Z: Well, nothing's being accumulated, so maybe not `activations_accumulator`. Using `activations` seems okay but I'm not sure if it's much more descriptive than `inputs`, and moreover (1) I forget if \"activations\" is meant to refer to the values before or after the nonlinearity, and (2) it's a bit jargon-y.\r\n\r\n@jakevdp We could just add the comment \"inputs = jnp.tanh(outputs)  # inputs for the next layer\" or something.\n- jakevdp commented on 2020-08-13T18:13:51Z: @chrisfcarroll I think the intent is \"outputs from one layer become inputs to the next\". Do you think a comment to that effect would have been sufficient to help you understand the intent?\n- chrisfcarroll commented on 2020-08-13T20:22:14Z: I would hate to be responsible for introducing a comment to explain a variable name into even a dummy piece of code. I think that if a function mutates a parameter, then calling that parameter an _input_ is a muddle; that if an example piece of code in a readme file uses `input` for a function's input & `output` for its output then I leap to the conclusion they are dummy names used just because it's an simple example function; and that if a name is so unclear a comment is needed to explain it then you should turn the comment into the name. So for all those reasons I'd go with activations rather than inputs. (Yes `activation` in an NN usually refers to _after_ the activation function, not before).\r\n\r\nBut it's not my code, so allow me to defer to your standards.\n- mattjj commented on 2020-08-13T20:49:03Z: There's no mutation here. It's just rebinding the name `input` locally.\n- chrisfcarroll commented on 2020-08-13T21:27:30Z: Sorry, please accept my apologies. My misreading, of course. I read and failed to see the loop.\r\n\r\nYes, I can see how the name `inputs` is correct. \r\n\r\nSo to your question, \u201cwhat is least likely to trigger somebody else thinking it's a typo\u201d, my best and serious suggestion is still either (a) `activations` or (b) add an explanatory variable called either `activations` or `current`\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef predict(params, inputs):\r\n  activations=inputs\r\n  for W, b in params:\r\n    outputs = jnp.dot(activations, W) + b\r\n    activations = jnp.tanh(outputs)\r\n  return outputs\r\n```\r\n\n- chrisfcarroll commented on 2020-08-14T10:44:26Z: Matt, Jake : I'm really sorry I turned this into a poor experience for you both when you were both trying hard to be positive. Thankyou for your patience. Next time I'll aim to read more carefully and react more slowly. Thanks, Chris.\n",

I think it works well and is a clear usability win, but we can't merge this PR in the current state because we would also need the feature in the C++ JIT, which is maintained as part of jaxlib.\r\n\r\nIf we're sure we want to do this, I suppose we should look into implementing it in C++ too, which is probably not too difficult (CC @jblespiau). I'm not entirely sure in what order that needs to happen with respect to merging this PR.\r\n\r\nI guess we need to reach consensus that this is what we want first. @jakevdp what do you think?\n- jblespiau commented on 2021-03-08T09:44:56Z: I only glanced rapidly (and did not get exactly how it was done), but I just wanted to say that it may be possible to do this in Python-land only, converting a call e.g. \r\n\r\nf(1, 2, kw1=3)\r\n\r\ninto f(1, 2, 3) so there would be no need for any C++ change (with some extra complexity for default keyword arguments).\n- shoyer commented on 2021-03-08T16:56:46Z: > I only glanced rapidly (and did not get exactly how it was done), but I just wanted to say that it may be possible to do this in Python-land only, converting a call e.g.\r\n\r\nThis is technically possible using the `inspect` module (@jakevdp wrote a notebook exploring this), but I don't recommend it. The problem is that `inspect` does its argument parsing in Python, so even parsing trivial cases adds 20-30 \u00b5s of overhead at each function call.\r\n\r\nThe current approach does some manipulation of the `**kwargs` dict, which I know can be done much faster in C++.\n- jakevdp commented on 2021-03-08T17:32:27Z: > I guess we need to reach consensus that this is what we want first. @jakevdp what do you think?\r\n\r\nI like this approach for the most part. I think there was some discussion about whether static arguments should be declared in the function definition vs declared at the call site. Do you recall the resolution there?\n- shoyer commented on 2021-03-08T18:16:10Z: > I like this approach for the most part. I think there was some discussion about whether static arguments should be declared in the function definition vs declared at the call site. Do you recall the resolution there?\r\n\r\nHere is that proposal from our internal chat:\r\n\r\n- The idea is that `jax.jit(f)(jax.static(x), y)` compiles to the same thing as `jax.jit(f, static_argnums=0)(x, y)` with the bonus that it documents staticness at the call site instead of far away at the jitting. It also works well with PyTrees.\r\n- static beats partial for two reasons:\r\n  1. it is much clearer to read function arguments in the natural order `f(w, static(x), y, static(z))` is much clearer than `partial(f, x=x, z=z)(w, y)`\r\n  2. it handles PyTrees more gracefully where you can have mixed static/dynamic pytrees instead of favoring the top-level arguments.\r\n\r\nMy take: `static` looks nice (particularly for inline uses of `jit`), but it's an orthogonal feature and we still need something like `static_argnames`. Library code written using JAX (including JAX itself) defines `jit` decorated functions, and those functions need some way to declare static arguments, unless we want to insist that users always box static arguments in `static` (which would be quite the change).\n- shoyer commented on 2021-03-29T21:55:27Z: See https://github.com/google/jax/pull/6273 for the immediate replacement here. We'll need to update the C++ machinery before exposing this publicly.\n- hawkinsp commented on 2021-04-09T13:47:56Z: https://github.com/google/jax/pull/6365 lands this support, including in the C++ `jit`.\n",

I think we need a sum type here, like\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nPartialVal = Known Const | Unknown AbstractValue\r\ntype Const = MaybeTraced JaxType\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're simulating that with tags, and with a pair instead of a (tag, optional const, optional aval) triple.\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty simple, as in there isn't any extra information being maintained AFAICT. Maybe it could be abstracted or rearranged?\n- chr1sj0nes commented on 2020-02-06T16:02:58Z: As demonstrated in this PR, I don't think the tag is necessary as `JaxType != AbstractValue`. There are several places in the code where `PartialVal`s are split into the `pv, const` pair, then reassembled later. I wonder if those can be eliminated by just passing the `PartialVal`s through.\n- jekbradbury commented on 2020-02-06T16:40:06Z: Yeah, I believe the tuple-as-sum-type might have been needed when JaxTypes could themselves be tuples, but now there\u2019s no ambiguity in a non-tupled pval about whether it\u2019s a aval or a const?\n- hawkinsp commented on 2023-03-04T17:56:39Z: Closing as stale.\n",
